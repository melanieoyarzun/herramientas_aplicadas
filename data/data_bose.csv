            ","I bought these for my wife's birthday, and gave them to her in August (purchased in July). She wanted a great bluetooth headset she could use to talk to friends while walking the dog. She used them first in late August, and reported that no-one could hear her while she walked outside if there was any wind or traffic. I said she must be doing something wrong, they were Bose and one of the key selling points was ""Advanced microphone system, HD voice for clear calls in windy or noisy environments"". We then took a trip for a couple of weeks to Europe and she began using again in late September. Same issues. We called Bose technical support and they said that this headset does not function well outside as a phone microphone and that they specifically do not recommend for that use. As this is EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE of what Amazon said, we called Amazon. They would not help us. The headphones are in perfect condition, only used 4 times but they said we were outside of the window for returns. They suggested we call Bose, and I again explained that Bose stated the Amazon product description was simply false. To no avail, even though we are HUGE customers. So, we are stuck with  $200+ purchase that does not work, purchased because of a flat out falsehood on Amazon's site. And they will not let us return.

            ","These headphones have amazing range, they really bring out the ""flavor"" of the music. I wear them all day at work both Bluetooth and corded, at my desk and at the gym, and I only charge them about once a week. Well worth the hefty price.**Update:The headband on the headphones that looks leather is some kind of thin plastic. After a few months it began crumbling and falling apart, which leaves those plastic flakes all in your hair and on your clothes. I have two friends that bought these right after me, and they have exactly the same problem, so it’s not just me. I contacted the Bose Community page and was told to cantact their customer support for a replacement pair. The customer support just sent me an email saying that they could sell me a replacement pair. After paying $250 for headphones, I’d expect them to last longer than a year, and if not, I’d expect the company to replace them free of charge. This has been a poor experience. I would not recommend these to anyone.

"3",5,"August 7, 2017","Color: Black",TRUE,"The BEST Headphones I Have Ever Used!!!
            ","EDIT: After owning these headphones for just a few days over a year, read my updated review beneath the original!After reading reviews and seeing nothing but outstanding remarks for these headphones, I decided to drop the cash and give it a shot. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I'm definitely an audiophile; I produced EDM music for quite a while which trained me to care about proper balance in songs. These headphones have AMAZING balance! Most expensive headphones that I've tried on just have a crazy boosted bass and it gives me a headache. Not to mention, it just doesn't sound good haha! Anyway, these headphones have super crisp highs, good mids, and crunchy bass. They really are perfect.As for comfort, I could easily wear these things all day. Sometimes I forget I'm even wearing these headphones... They look pretty stylish and they aren't too big. The carrying case is pretty lowkey and it works fine, no problems there. Headphones charge fast and the battery lasts me about a week with daily usage.I enjoy the little voice that sounds whenever you switch devices or turn on the headphones. It's not obnoxious in the slightest. Bluetooth is always a little finicky but these headphones connect almost flawlessly. They automatically reconnect to your last device and that makes things go A LOT faster! Switching devices is pretty simple too.Using the included aux cord doesn't effect sound quality at all. Good for conserving battery life is you don't particularly need the wireless feature at the time of listening!Overall, I'm more than satisfied with my purchase. It was well worth the money and I would recommend these headphones to anyone AND everyone! If you have any questions, leave a comment and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.EDIT:As mentioned above, I've owned these headphones for a little over a year now and I'm still impressed. Even after 1 entire year of extensive use (multiple road trips, a whole school year in the backpack, recording, listening, calling) these still work flawlessly and I've had ZERO major problems whatsoever. Long story short, I'm still sticking with the 5 star review. Below is a little more detail:Physical: No physical damage at all. I try to take care of my stuff, but accidents happen and these headphones have not sustained any scratches, dents, or cracked despite my heavy usage. The foam-ish headband piece still holds its shape. The earphones are still fluffy and squishy (no tears or deformities). At some point in my 1 year of ownership, the little piece of fabric that has the ""L"" on it (inside the left ear cup; it covers the electronics and such) started slipping out, but I was able to finagle it back in and there's been no problem since. I use the case basically whenever I transport these headphones and that's probably the main reason they've maintained physical integrity. Highly recommend using that case. It's small, sleek, and effective.Sound: I haven't owned any other headphones since these so I can't compare the sound of other headphones to these, however, I'm about to purchase a Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro which is known for it's studio quality, neutral sound. I'll compare the sound when I purchase them. I have noticed problems occasionally when connected to multiple devices. If the headphones are connected to my iPhone and my MacBook I sometimes have a little lag when watching YouTube. But as mentioned by another reviewer, turning on and off the headphones solves this. I don't get too many phone calls, but the several calls I've had while wearing these headphones were crystal clear and easy to understand (on both ends, I asked). I've had several VERY minor issues with the Bluetooth connectivity overall, but Bose regularly puts out firmware updates for their hardware and they've solved many of these issues. I'd say check about once a month for updates on their update site: http://btu.bose.com/The only negative: since these are over-the-ear headphones, they have some natural sound cancelling properties, but after I tried out some Bose Active Noise Cancelling Headphones at Target, I can't even BEGIN to explain how amazing the active noise cancelling was. With the Bose SoundLink headphones, the natural noise cancelling is good. It blocks out a majority of background noise and outsiders cannot hear my music at all (unless it's turned up very high... don't do that!). But with the active noise cancelling headphones, it's almost magical. You put those headphones on and it's just dead silent. These headphones are perfect as they are, but if you can afford it, go for a pair of Bose headphones with active noise cancelling. Just my suggestion.Tip: If you use these headphones for mixing (which I'll update the sound comparison part of this review when I get my new DT770 Pro's), make sure to use the custom aux cable provided. This ensures there's no Bluetooth interference and you get the clearest sound quality. These aren't studio headphones, but if you want headphones to use in combination with studio monitors (as a reference listening device) or if you need a good pair of monitor headphones that can double as comfort/listening headphones, these work great.

"6",5,"November 3, 2015","Color: White",TRUE,"Expensive, and NO REGRETS.
            ","Something I hadn't read (or noticed) when narrowing down my options, is that this pair of headphones can listen to 2 sources simultaneously. So while I'm listening to my computer for work, it's still connected to my phone, and I can hear when someone is calling, and can even take the call while still listening to my computer. This is something I didn't know was possible, and is 100% what I needed. I'm SO happy with this purchase.Aside from that feature, which may not apply to anyone else, these are the MOST comfortable headphones I have ever purchased. I have a pair of wired Bose at home, that have lasted for several years. They are super comfortable as well, but these really take the cake. Somewhere in their product description, they say you never want to take them off, and it's true.I'm also very impressed by the battery life. I leave them charging on Friday night, so Monday morning, they are at 100% (she tells you every time you turn them on what the percentage of battery life is!), and by Friday afternoon, they're usually around 30-40%, and I wear them 10 hours a day!They also get the best reception of any wireless headphones I've ever used. I can walk around my building and still hear my computer, and they don't cut out like my old Bluetooth ones did.I also have only had very slight sound delay. But then I turned them off and back on, and the delay was gone. But it wasn't even a full second of sound delay- just a fraction of a second, so it might not be noticeable to anyone just listening to music without using visuals.I don't know what else to say about these headphones. They are perfect. I'm so very glad I splurged. I know they are THE ONES and will last me a very long time.Bose knows, man. Bose knows.

            ","My son loved his Bose headphones until the wireless died at 1.5 years.  Wish I bought the 3 year coverage.  Or that I bought them in Europe where they are required to give a 2 year warranty.  (Why don't we get that in the US? At $230 for a pair of headphones, 2 year coverage seems reasonable.)  Guess I will have to try a different brand--too bad Bose.

"8",3,"April 3, 2017","Color: Black",TRUE,"Good sound, bad comfort.
            ","I'm giving these 3 stars only because the sound is very good and they are nice looking and lightweight.  But I'm astonished at the construction for headphones that cost this much.  I do have larger than average sized ears; most headphones will pinch a bit on the upper part of my right ear after an hour or so, although over the years I've found a few that fit me comfortably indefinitely.  But these are, well, simply crappy comfort-wise in almost every way.  And they hurt both ears and in new and unexpected ways and places after only a few minutes.  Where you normally find padding at the thicker area along the back of the ear, these have a kind of channel between the cushioning and the sound producing area where your ear slips in.  In that channel there are hard plastic bumps and knobs and also a hard plastic ring.  And under the flimsy striped fabric covering the housing (which is only attached on one side) there are more hard plastic bumps.  Ouch, ouch, ouch.  I guess if you have small to medium ears and don't look too closely you might never notice this stuff, but still, $296 for this?

"9",5,"March 19, 2018","Color: Black",TRUE,"Best bang for buck premium wireless headphones - STILL!
            ","Recently had my old SL 2s snagged at the gym. I always loved em but now that I had the chance to get the latest and greatest - it was time to shop around. After looking at the B&O Play 8i Sony 1000M2’s and Bose QC 35 II’s the question was were they better enough than the SL Ii to justify an extra $130 to $180?The Plays had issues so headed to Best Buy to listen to the Sony and Bose phones. They were both good - both had dramatic presentations with good detail on top decent mids and thundering bass. Of the two I preferred the Sony’s feeling the QC 35 2’s bass was unnatural sounding and not well integrated.What I loved about the Soundlinks Ii soundwise was it’s more natural sounding non-fatiguing presentation. On the chance the Sony’s slightly overwrought sound would wear on me and the $130 price increase I finally rebought the SoundLink II’s.Ordered this morning and they’re sitting atop my big head as I write this.  Granted I listen mostly to classical, jazz and electronic music but I very much prefer this sound still to what I heard from the Sony and Bose QC 2’s. Love the comfort, easy no hassle blue tooth connections and the money I saved. Best bang for the buck going for premium over ear bt cans. Paid $375 first time around. STILL highly recommended!

My wife enjoys making calls with these... no complaints from the folks on the other side about a bad connection, no cutting out, and they can hear my wife just fine.Note... my wife is VERY picky and sensitive about things around her ears. I literally could not tell you how many pairs of sunglasses she has gone through as 99% will end up squeezing her head and give her a headache.  So I was hopeful she would be able to use these and she has had them on for up to 6-8hrs straight while working around the house. No issues with squeezing her head.

Plus the rubber trim ring was starting to pull away from the earphone cups on both sides.I spent 20 minutes on the phone with Bose's Philippine tech support center but they could not get the mike to work, either.WTF, Bose?

            ","I absolutely love these headphones. I was hesitant to spend this much on headphones, but I'm so glad I did. They're great for work because you can be connected to multiple devices at once. Controls and switching between them is super simple. Sound is amazing, battery life is great, charges relatively quickly, and in a pinch, you have a cord that allows you to use the headphones without a charge. (Note, though that the mic doesn't work if you use the headphone jack to directly plug into a device.)The only reason I'm rating this a four is that after a couple months of use, I've had random issues with crunchy sounds from the bluetooth connection. More so annoying than impeding usage because it happens infrequently. Additionally, I've been told that my voice occasionally goes robotic, 8-bit like, when I'm on the phone or a web conference. Not always, but enough to have it be irritating that I'm having issues with something that cost so much. I've confirmed it's these headphones because the second I switch them off or switch headphones, my voice quality improves to those listening.All that to say.

I have owned these headphones for two years to the date and the right ear cup stopped working. Even being very meticulous about caring for them, they just stopped working.

I feel the Beats look better than Bose, but in my opinion looks are the only thing Beats do better than Bose.  Beats have quite a reputation of quality and performance, and when I first put them on and tried them out I thought ""huh, well maybe something is wrong with this pair"".  Then I thought ""maybe it really is only good for bass"",  so I played some bass heavy music, but was still very disappointed.  The sound was muddy and weak.  I returned them and bought the Bose.  There is not even a comparison between the two, the Bose sound crystal clear, and the highs-mids- and lows are head and shoulders above the Beats.  Songs that I've listened to hundreds of times sound brand new, and I can hear tones I've never heard before.  These are light and comfortable.

"18",3,"May 17, 2018","Color: Black",TRUE,"It's a love hate relationship
            ","These headphones provide a bit of a love/hate relationship. I love that the sound is pretty incredible, and ultimately has the best bass of any wireless headset I have heard to date though it lacks compared to Bose cable driven headphones. I love that the battery lasts forever - I've watched movies, talked on the phone and listened to music for an entire day and still had 80% left. I love that I can connect to two devices at once (laptop, phone).Now for the things I don't like, and the problem is I really hate these issues.  I hate that they are uncomfortable. I have rather large ears, so the cusps don't go fully around my ears and make it very uncomfortable after a short time. I typically just put up with it until my ears fall asleep, but when you pull them off it literally hurts. I hate that when on a call it has a tendency to break up the audio. The mic seems to continue picking up fine, but listening to the other person can be problematic. I hate the mic, but I didn't really buy these for calling, but just the convenience of answering a call if I am listening to music, but the mic comes across like you are in a room that echos and you sound somewhat flat, so if your intent is to use this for phone calls, I recommend looking elsewhere.So where do I stand? I think they are good headphones, and probably much better if you have smaller ears. Do I think it was worth the investment? Not for me.  I plan on looking for another set sometime very soon. If anyone has ever had Turtle Beaches (not the wireless ones, they are bad for sound quality) but the comfort of turtle beaches is a million times better than these.

I understand that there might be some loss of quality when using Bluetooth, but it shouldn't be noticeably different. The highs on the headphones seem to clip and distort, causing a slight static/hissing sound.After researching I've discovered that these headphones stream at a lower audio compression codec on the Mac called SBC. Instead of using the higher quality AAC coded. This for sure is why the headphone sound is subpar on the Mac.The other terrible thing is the mic quality.

            ","First, the feature of pairing with more than one device might work, to some degree, but the problems it causes try to re-link back to primary device leaves something to be desired.  Second, the quality of the construction materials is questionable considering that at about 18 months age, with NO exposure to moisture, the banding around the headphone body  started separating, on both sides!  Third, considering the cost of these headphones, a 1 Year Warranty smacks of a lack of confidence in their product, and then the subsequent failure experienced seems to support this hypothesis.Subsequent to the failure, Customer Support was contacted, and the agent offered to exchange the headphones at a discounted price (lower than new, but still substantial $$), promising to expedite the exchange.  While I kept my part of this agreement, and they immediately charged my Credit Card, they failed to keep their end of the promise.  Subsequent conversations with the Customer Support failed to resolve the shipping issue, with nothing but lip service given, saying it was just a function of their internal policies and procedures and they couldn't do anything.  With the price of Bose products being what they are, and what now appears to be a lack of trust with their customers (basically they didn't trust that I had actually shipped the physical product back to them), I probably won't buy Bose products in the future.

I find that earbuds at not comfortable so on eat or over ear headphones were what I was looking for.  They are light & the ""grip"" around my head is gentle so they don't cause undo pressure.  The padding on the headband & the earpieces were far more comfortable than any other headphone I tried (Beats included).  After using them for a couple of weeks I'm very happy with my choice.  Even with my glasses, I find them to be very comfortable.  Occasionally there's some discomfort with larger earrings but I'm usually able to readjust & find a more amenable position.The next consideration was sound dampening.  It's not super noisy but there is a significant amount of background noise (talking, printer, etc.).  Based on the type of noise (more variable than steady drone) I wasn't sure that the active noise cancelling of the Quiet Comfort model was worth the additional cost (paid $229).  These headphones do completely cover the ears which passively blocks quite a bit of sound.  Between that & the music itself, the background noise became a non-issue.Of course, what good are headphones if they don't sound good?  Unlike some others that I have tried there's no background hiss.  The sound is clear & crisp.  I've discovered some previously unnoticed nuances to my music as a result of the superior sound quality.  The balance is very pleasant.  You won't find pounding base, rather a nice mix of tones that will allow you to appreciate a broader range of instrumentals & vocals.Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase.  I couldn't ask for a better set of headphones for my needs.

            ","I recently bought the Wireless Bose Soundlink and two days later a pair of Sennheiser 4.5 E heaphones..  The reviews for both are pretty much on target, but I am very pleased to say that the Bose Soundlink gives amazingly excellent sound  for a wireless headset.  The controls are easy to use, the ear-cups are very comfortable.  In fact this headphone will stack it up against other wired Bose headphones and Sennheisers  I have purchasaed in the $300+ range.  So why buy the Sennheisers? A half price sale of $100 is hard to turn down, but the Sennheisers are uncomfortable, cumbersome controls, and the audio sound is no better than the Bose. For the extra bucks I will go with the Bose.  They do function for cellphone calls, but I will not use them driving.  To have a headset of this quality without hassling with wires is definitely worth the money. As for the Sennheisers, they seem very cheaply made, not up to German standards, and I suspect they are made in China and only have the Sennheiser name.  A shame.  I probably have a grandkid or two with a small head and small ears,  and X-mas is ony 5 months away.

The Sony rated very high for sound, and features, but Bose had the old school reputation as dependable. I decided on the Bose for a couple of reason. They have the reputation, and a customer complained very loudly about Sony customer service, in the comment section.I truly did not want to spend that much for headphones, but after using the product for about 3 weeks, it was truly worth it. I have a graveyard of bluetooth headphones, where the wires goes bad, but the Bose fit very snugly, sound great, and the battery charge last longer than my 2 shifts of work.(work 2  jobs).

            ","I was looking for a pair of headphones to help me with video/VOIP calls in a noisy office environment as an upgrade to my Jabra 370 – I tried Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II – Bose SoundLink II – Microsoft Surface and all three failed.Bose QC35 best sound qualitySurface failed to work with iPhone X and iPad ProSoundlink isn’t noise cancellingAll three have microphones that amplify ALL VOICES IN THE ROOM – failTurns out the Jabra 370 really is the best for office communications, but not for taming noisy office.Our company just moved to a new open office design. That means no walls, no offices, all open space with desks, work stations and huddle areas. I had an office until we moved and was going from speakerphone to headphones. We are a global company thus video conferencing and VOIP con calls are constant on Zoom, Skype, WebEx etc.I already have a Bluetooth wireless headset Jabra 370, it is “on the ear” with a boom microphone, I thought an “around the ear” would help better with the new noisy office. The Jabra 370 uses a USB transmitter and is pretty much tied to desktops/laptops.Now, about my special circumstances, I have a hearing disability and wear a hearing aid and Cochlear Implant. For this review what that means is that I hear from things that sit on my ear rather then inside my ear and because I already have the hearing aids cannot wear an ear bud arrangement. I am an IT professional.This review is of all three subject headsets:1) Noise Cancellation for Other Party – (FAIL) that is, when on a call what does the other side hear? And here all three failed, on calls the other parties could hear voices from all across the office because the microphone arrays would pick up every voice in the room. For the QC35 weirdly it was only when I was speaking – deathly silent when I wasn’t, but the moment I began to speak all the other voices in the room came through loud and clear, very distracting to the folks on other end of the call, at one point they could hear a conversation 35 feet away very clearly that I couldn't hear because of the headset2) Noise Cancellation for Wearer– The Soundlink is not noise cancelling (I thought all Bose were) and therefore, it cannot work in a noisy open office environment, the Bose QC35 did the best job of noise cancellation, the Surface okayBut about noise cancellation – Bose is made for like a plane non-voice noisy environment, in an open office where the “noise” is other people talking on phones or in groups, the Bose actually makes the problem WORSE by amplifying surrounding voices3) Call Quality – all three had good call quality on Win10 bluetooth, but the Surface had terrible quality for other party on the iPhone X and iPad, the other end and con calls could not hear me like I was in a tunnel4) Pairing - All three headsets paired easily with my Win10 Lenovo corporate laptop, Win10 Surface Book 2 personal laptop, iPad Pro and iPhone X5) No boom microphone – all three use a microphone array in the ear cup rather than boom microphone, my voice was clear on all three, but other side said QC35 was best soundBut note other voices are picked up as well6) Surround the ear – all three styles are designed to fit around the ear entirely instead of on or in the ear, I was worried about discomfort based upon other reviews and the Surface has small ear cups, but all fit well over my (somewhat) oversized Obama type ears. The Bose were the most comfortable, in a warm office I can tell the Surface would have a sweat issue7) Sound clarity – all three had very good voice sound clarity, but the Bose QC35 did so with less volume turned up, volume of 8 – 10 for others while volume of 5 on Bose QC35 to hear the same thing8) Interoperability – all three operated fine on all manner of video, voip, UCaaS and web calls9) Multi-device – in theory all three are supposed to connect to both phone and computer for dual inputs, I guess to hear music and then take a call or conversation, in reality that is horrible because my VOIP calls were constantly interrupted by the alerts and messages from my phone, the headset was constantly switching back and forth, and once, my iPhone randomly began playing music during a VOIP con call10) Digital Aid/Cochlear – all three work fine with digital hearing and BTE hearing aids, and Advanced Bionics Cochlear implant11) Sound Quality – my focus was on voice clarity not music, all three have excellent sound quality, The QC35 the best, then the Surface and then the Soundlink, the volume on the QC35 did not have to go as high to get the same results as the other two

Very disappointingExceptional sound, great range, long battery life. I would definitely buy them again, but I have two quibbles. The first is the size of the ear muffs. While I don't large ears, the ear muffs pinch the tops of my ears and so I periodically have to take them off to relieve the eventual pain. The second has to do with the controls. A single button to control backward and forward by pressing twice for forward and thrice for backward is clumsy. A separate button for each may not be as cost effective as using software to give one button three functions (it's also used for pause), but from the perspective of the end user, more buttons make more sense.

I have used over 20 Bluetooth devices over the years and I have never had the pairing/connection issues I have had with these headphones. I have tried to pair them with two of my cell phones, 2 computers, my kids tried them with their phones and chrome books. With all these devices it has the hardest time connecting and I am sure I have it in pairing mode each time (after simply selecting connect on the settings of the device trying to connect it to never works).

They sport a feature called 'sidetone', which projects ambient noise into the headphones when you are using the microphone. This feature is supposed to help your voice sound more natural to you while you are talking, which it does.However, if you try to use them to voice chat while playing a game, they make your experience miserable by disabling other sounds from your pc and blasting your own keyboard and mouse noises through your headset. I've tried to figure out how to turn this feature off with no success. My only solution was to use a separate microphone while playing, so that these headphones are forced to break down and work like normal headphones because they don't know your mic is on.

            ","I have been wanting some wireless headphones for a long time but I was finding the prices too high.  I jumped at the chance to review these wireless headphones when they became available.  Here is what I like about these earphones so far: - They are very comfortable to wear.  Though I am a fully grown female, I have to wear therm on the smallest sized so I don't think these would work for smaller kids unless they have big heads. They will extend quite a lot so even my big-headed husband can comfortably wear them. - The material around the ears is extremely soft and supple.  I don't think it's leather (might be) but it's very easy to wear these for hours at a time.  And I am very picky about what's on my head. - The sound coming through is incredibly good.  I was watching a movie and actually got startled when a helicopter in the movie flew right over my house but it was actually the stereo in the headphones.  Very realistically clear.  Listening to classical guitar music through these is almost as good as being at the concert in person....maybe better except you can't watch the guitarist play in person.  I teach classical guitar and am very particular about the sound quality of the instrument through any speaker. I have no complaints whatsoever in the sound quality of these headphones. - The distance I can get from the source is everywhere in my house.  I can go down into the basement or upstairs and still maintain a strong bluetooth connection.  I went outside (we have a solid brick house) and was able to get approximately 20-30 feet away before the connection started to break up. - These headphones are lightweight and the earphones are slim with the contours of your face.  I like the narrow profile. - Very clear audio when using the phone.  People I spoke with said they could hear me loud and clear including leaving voice mail messages. - Connected via bluetooth to all of my devices easily except my chromebook.  These devices were: phone, laptop, tablet and iPod 4 so far. - Relatively quick recharge.  My earphones came with some charge in the battery, but I exhausted it and they shut off.  I connected them to a wall outlet using the enclosed USB cord and an adapter and in about an hour they were fully charged. - What's included: a soft, zippered pouch case (no strap or handle), USB and a cord to hardwire the earphones to a device.  I used that wire to watch and listen to Youtube videos on my chromebook. - The instructions come in a LOT of different languages. - Online registration was easy. - Every time they are turned on the automated voice tells you how much battery you have left. - It's very easy to answer phone calls, and adjust the volume on the right side earphone. - These can get very loud. - It's really freeing to be able to wear these headphones to listen to my favorite podcasts or music and not be tethered to the computer by a cord.  I can move about the entire house freely doing what it is I need/want to do.  That's the biggest perk!What I don't like: - I can't figure out how to get these to connect via bluetooth to my chromebook.  Other bluetooth devices will connect but the earphones won't.  I will keep trying and update if I get it to connect.- They don't filter out outside ambient noise very well so don't expect them to exclude a lot of external sounds much while using them.  I can still hear everything my husband and kids are saying unless I turn them up louder.UPDATE:  3.30.17 - These are still working flawlessly and I use them for hours every evening listening to my favorite Youtube videos.  Soft and comfortable, they hold a charge for a L-O-N-G time too and recharge extremely fast.Overall:  I find these to be very good having crisp, clear, bright and exceptional sound quality.  Easy to wear for long periods of time, and the battery life seems long.  I don't know how much they cost since as of this review the product page has not been posted.

            ","These headphones sound great to me, although I am not an audiophile.  However, I took a star off since the power button on the right ear cup rattles back and forth (side to side, not up and down as one might expect from the way you switch it on) as I am walking around the house.  This is not noticeable if you're listening to bass-drenched music, but if you are listening to classical music it's really annoying.  Fortunately, a low tech fix is readily available by putting painter's tape over the button to keep it in place.  But I spent over $270 for headphones where the power button is so poorly designed that it distracts from the listening experience?  This was my first Bose product, and I can't say that it was 100% worth the money.

So when I saw a pretty good deal for these Soundlinks, I figured it was a no-brainer.But I was dead wrong. The sound quality on these headphones is terrible. The sound is muddy even to my non-professional ears. It is not merely a question of the usual Bose emphasis on the bass. In comparison with my other Bose products, the clarity of sound was lacking at every level, including the base, to the point where I have to think that it is possible that I got a defective set. But I think it is more likely that the poor performance is from the bluetooth wireless (plus the need for an amp to handle my iPhone & iPad? - I don't know if that's an issue for wireless...)Putting aside the sound, the headphones were very comfortable, the controls easy to access and use, and it was a piece of cake to connect them to my devices. But so what, if the sound is bad?So be aware that if you buy a pair of these, test them out immediately in case you, too, have to return them.

While I would rate the QC35's sound as superior with noise cancelling turned on, they actually sound much different with noise cancelling turned off. So comparing both with noise cancelling off, I settled on these as being a bit more rich.I have a very large head and I only need to open these up to the third notch, so I'm very happy with that.

I can't speak to range since my apartment isn't all that large, but I do have walls and I have never had my connection sputter due to physical interference.My one gripe is with the attempts to connect when it powers on. The two devices I mainly have this paired with are my Apple TV and my laptop. When I turn these on to use with the TV and the laptop is closed/asleep, the headphones just keep trying to connect to the laptop, repeating over and over again, ""connecting to..."" So I have to open my laptop, allow it to connect so it will shut up, and then I can continue use. It's one of those really unfortunate quirks that falls short of what I want to expect from Bose, or really any top tech product in 2016. That said, everything else is so great, that it's never going to be a dealbreaker, and still a five-star product in my opinion.

"271",5,"December 6, 2017","Color: Black",TRUE,"Exactly the quality expected with a name like Bose!
            ","These headphones are AMAZING!! I've used so many headphones over the years and they all come up short in one way or another. Firstly, these are super light and have a perfect fit. There are no gaps behind or below the ears. My big ears fit easily inside each cup with no compression. With some styles of headphones, the tension is great enough to give me a headache. These are snug enough to maintain a seal, but not tight enough to give me any discomfort.The audible cues are clear and concise with power on and connecting. They connect very fast to devices. The firmware update process is painless and very quick (updated multiple minor versions in less than 5 minutes). The sound quality is second to none: deep bass with crisp highs. The sound dampening is very effective (I didn't hear my alarm go off and I didn't even have the volume up all the way). The microphone works very well with phone calls, Facetime, and WebEx without picking up ambient noise.There are only a few drawbacks, but they're easily mutable. For one, when connected to two devices, sometimes the audio will get choppy. Bose is aware of the issue and is addressing it with firmware updates in the near future. There's an easy fix for it for now which is to simply disconnect from one of the devices and the sound quality returns to normal. The other issue I've noticed is the headphones show up with two outputs on my computer, which has caused issues initially with WebEx not choosing the correct output by default. Once you set that manually, it sticks.Overall, these are still the best headphones I've ever had!

"280",5,"December 19, 2016","Color: Black",TRUE,"Excellent, amazing sound, good bass, tight treble
            ","I had a pair of Skullcandy Hesh-2 Bluetooth headphones prior to buying the Bose. The Hest-2 were a $100 pair of headphones and were definitely worth the price, though the battery only lasted a year. The sound fidelity between the Bose and Hesh-2 is night and day. The Hesh-2 were boomy and pushed the mids a bit too much. The Bose have an excellent sound curve with tight and low bass, flat mids, and crisp highs. The sound replication is very accurate and these will reveal the quality in music that you've been missing. You'll want to crack out your EQ (whether on your phone or home stereo) as you'll find you can push a lot of different frequencies through these.When it comes to home theater and movies, you'll need to switch from surround sound to 2-ch stereo...if you don't, you'll get a bit of a distant, tin-can-spacey-feel to the surround sound. Switching to 2-channel stereo gets you close to where you want to be with an excellent representation of the soundstage. In the beginning of Star Trek Beyond, when the Enterprise is being attacked by Krall swarm, you'll hear the attacks sweep across from the rear-left to the right, giving you a good impression of a larger soundstage. Sadly, the mids and vocals in today's movies requires separate channels and you'll lose a bit here with the Bose. Thus, while they're good for movies and surround sound, they're not great unless you tweak the equalizer to push these a bit.Bluetooth Latency: as with almost all Bluetooth headphones, there is a bit of signal lag based on the distance you sit from the TV and the amount of time it takes to process that sound through the various CODECS between the devices. The Bose are no different and the only way I've ever found to bypass that is to tweak the speaker delay on the receiver or just use the analog cable. My experience of sitting 8' away from the television using an MPOW bluetooth transmitter plugged into my receiver's headphone output to the Bose Headphones incurs a delay of about 22ms; just enough to be noticeable after a minute or two. YMMV.Pairing was a snap as the headphones have voice prompts to tell you what Bluetooth profile they're connected to. This is fantastic feature when switching from your mobile phone to your desktop, or from your laptop and to your home stereo, etc. Just flip the head phones to the middle ""on"" position, then push the slider up to cycle through the different bluetooth connections until you hear the one you want. Less fiddling in the dark and messing with the profiles on your phone or other devices to get them to connect to the right source. Brilliant!There is a nice carrying case and a very short analog cable to use without bluetooth or for regular stereo/headphone connections.

Connectivity is quick, and the range from device to headphones is on the better side of average. These aren't noise-cancelling; they are more like ""noise-muffling,"" which is fine for how I'm using them. If you want noise-cancelling, I believe Bose makes another model. I waited months to pull the trigger on these after lots of research and deliberation. After putting up with crappy Chinese knockoffs for far too long, I don't know how I ever lived without these.The + button suddenly stopped working, so I opened one aide of the headphone to investigate. The piece of sodder that holds the internal button has detached, leaving the button, bracket, and piece of sodder rattling around in the housing. I purchased these back in September, so they only lasted 9 months. For the money I spent, this is extremely disappointing. I contacted Amazon, but because I'm outside the ""return window"" for these, they won't do anything about it. Lesson learned.

            ","I have always enjoyed Bose Quiet Comfort noise canceling headphones.  But over the years they have morphed away from ""white"" noise that really did cancel out background ambient noise.  The most recent wired Bose Quiet Comfort series had little noise canceling effect. But fantastic audio and comfort benefits.The new pair I ordered on Amazon, (Bluetooth) are very well made, easy to charge, hold their charge for an extraordinary amount of time. They pair easily, hold signal to the device they are paired with at great distance.  The audio and comfort are outstanding.  However they have ZERO noise canceling benefit. A good pair of foam 10 cent ear plugs are much better if you are simply looking for shutting out the crying kid on aisle seat 4A.Years ago we flew to Europe in first class, (25 years ago) and they offered Bose noise canceling earphones for the singular purpose of canceling out ambient noise.  They were incredible!  Like going ""deaf""....but they required a large electronic controller to accomplish that intense ""white"" noise.  They were hard wired to power as well.  I think Bose cannot deliver extreme noise cancelling earphones using any form of lightweight battery. So having written all this...if you want amazing sound from a wireless headset, easy to recharge with great battery life, easy pairing, along with the ability to hold signal a distance. You will love these as I do. And very comfortable as well, very lightweight.

I've not had fantastic luck with bluetooth headphones. These perform very well in my opinion, the only issue I've run into with them is if you have your phone and a computer connected to them (yes you can have two devices), and you're getting a ton of messages on your phone, it does break up a little bit. But if you really don't need to have your phone connected - you're good.I have jaw issues and some around ear headphones can put pressure on my jaw joint, but these do not!

            ","This is my second pair of headphones (first one being MDR-V6 from Sony) and my first pair of bluetooth headphones. Compared to the MDR-V6, which is sub $100, the Soundlink II is much lighter, more comfortable, and more suitable for travel. The headband is not as wide so my hair does not look funny and compressed when I take off the headphones. The Soundlink II also has less bass than the MDR-V6, but better noise isolation with the ear pads. Overall it is a great product, except the noise problem.The noise, probably white, sounds like what you would hear when you record the ambient sound with a microphone and play it back at the loudest volume. It does not happen when I use the cable. When I pair the headphones with a Windows 7 machine, I would hear a click and pop followed by 3 seconds of white noise every time I open or change to a different folder in Windows Explorer. More importantly, the white noise is always present when I'm playing the music, and it's the same with Android. The noise level does not change regardless of the volume control on Windows and the headphones. The noise is usually shadowed when the music is loud, but it is very noticeable during the opening, and it can sometimes overwhelm the music if the sound level is low.I find it surprising that none of the professional reviews on Youtube mention this problem. I don't know if this is just the nature of bluetooth headphones because I have never owned bluetooth headphones before, but I would think with the cost of $270 this pair of headphones should be able to do better than this. Personally, I think this pair of headphones is usable, but people who want ultra high sound quality might want to avoid it.

            ","I've been using these for video editing on my iMac for 6 months, and they have been great.I wanted wireless headphone so that I could stay mobile at my desk. It was important that I could move around to look at notes, step back from the screen to watch a rough cut, and to have my keyboard and mouse free of interfering headphone wires. With wired headphones, all these seemingly simple tasks become annoying, since you have to constantly take your headphones on and off.So far the headphones have been great for this purpose. The sound quality is up to par, the bluetooth pairing with Apple devices is very easy, and the connection is precise (i.e. there is no audio lag when editing). For reference, I've used them with Premiere Pro and FCPX with equal ease and precision.1 star removed because:1. The battery isn't replaceable (although the headphones do charge surprisingly fast, in a matter of minutes)2. The wired option requires an annoying 2.5mm to 3.5mm audio cableOverall though, I really like these headphones and would reccomend them to other video editors looking for a simple solution!

            ","Bought these for a busy work environment. I opted for this model because I liked teh versatility of the wireless  Blutetooth feature or wired. Doing so means you opt out of Bose's other model with full noise-cancellation. Although these headphones do not truly cancel out noise using frequency modulation, they do inherently as over-the-ear headphones do this by proxy.The unit is more comfortable than I expected, and I don't think they warmed up to the point of perspiration for me in teh hour I wore them, but I imagine if I was doing anything physically active it might change that - perfect for sitting at your desk. I wouldn't recommend running in them.I discovered sounds in my music that I had never heard just plugged into the phone jack of my car. These headphones however lost a few points for lack of bass. Not that I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, but it seems like they don't handle this just by subduing the bass, the bass actually becomes ""tinny"". If I adjust the volume to a more modest level (probably the level I should be listening) this seems to be better.I did receive one phone call and it was seamless from music to call and back to music. The caller didn't even know that they were on my headset, so no more speaker calls.

I tested both before finally settling on the Soundlink's. The sound quality is fantastic for what I need them for, good balance of high's, mid's and low's. Definitely not a lot of bass if that's what you are into. Very clear, very good quality. I was replacing a broken set of Beat headphones, absolutely no comparison in terms of sound quality, Bose is the clear winner here. IF the Q35's had the option to turn the noise cancelling off when I wanted, I would have bought them, but I work in an office setting where I need to be able to hear by boss yelling at me from time to time. If I didn't, I'd no longer be able to afford these headphones... The Q35's noise cancelling abilities are truly incredible if that's what you are looking for. I was standing in-front of a huge stereo blaring music and with the Q35's, I could feel the thumping and vibration in my chest yet no sound from the stereo, truly remarkable...Whatever you decide, I recommend going into a Bose Store if you can to try them out and do your own comparison.

            ","I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective.

            ","I'm switching back and forth between my Sony H.ear on Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones and the Bose SoundLink's trying to gauge what differences I can hear. The Bose have great sound but just as the Sony's, but a little more base in the Sony's.  And to me it sounds like the Bose SoundLink's have frequencies 500 and 1K playing slightly above Sony's H.ear.  So Sony's H.ear sounds just slightly more creamy and slightly more non computerized, where as the Bose SoundLinks sound slightly more computerized and digital, and grainy.  Although you can argue that slight graininess is due to the super pristine clear sound.  I'll Give Bose 5 stars for perfect sound, but I still personally prefer the Sony line.  At first I was a little pissed at all the overdoing it with extra bass on the Sony headphones  [ I have had more than 1 pair ], but then it dawned on me that the extra base really does make things sound better.  The Sony H.ear headphones vs the Bose SoundLink, i'd have to give it to Sony.  I have both headphones, i'm very tempted to return these Bose headphones and get another pair of Sony's.  I haven't made up my mind yet.

I might as well had two tin cans strapped to my ears.  After using the Bose for a few weeks I am impressed with the overall clarity.  I am hearing things in songs I haven't heard in years.  They are light weight, fit over my large head/ears, very comfortable and the battery is long lasting.  These Bose headphones do have great bass.

I figured it must have been an isolated issue that was probably fixed by now.  However, they started skipping and stuttering immediately while I was trying to listen to an Audible book. I had my phone charging at first about ten feet away, so I thought maybe it was the range (although they’re supposed to reach 33 feet). I took the phone off the charger and carried it in my pocket, but the connection issues persisted. It’s enough to drive you crazy!! For such an expensive pair of wireless headphones to have persistent wireless connectivity problems is absolute madness. I got a cheap complimentary pair of wireless headphones from a hotel a while back that work better than these $229 headphones. I gave two stars instead of one because the sound quality is decent and they work well with the wire, but the entire reason I bought them was for the wireless capability. I’m returning and buying Sony from Best Buy.  I say Best Buy because I’ve had a string of B grade and faulty equipment from Amazon over the last year. It’s such a trend that it can’t be a coincidence. They’re helping manufacturers offload questionable inventory and selling it at the same retail price. Either that or the long warehouse storage is hurting the products. I’m losing faith in Amazon quickly.  Long time Prime customer but the quality standard has consistently fallen since I joined.

I have another pair of headphones from bluedio that had two sets of volume, one from the phone and one from the actual headphones which I like if I ever want to really blast my music and pump me up.

For the iphone, it'll work great. It'll work great with both those together, the iphone taking over when the phone gets a call or whatever. On the PC, you need a functional bluetooth stack. CSR Harmony's seems to work best with it, but if you want it connect automatically to the computer you will need to disable bluetooth on your iPhone (or not set it up for bluetooth on the phone). Until I did that I had to manually click through to activate it. Add to that that unlike some cheaper bluetooth headsets, you can't charge these and use them at the same time, the included cable is far too short and they seem to disconnect when hooked up to the charger. I suppose you could still use them in fully wired mode then, but I haven't tried.In programs on the PC, sometimes charging it or disconnecting it made you restart the application to get audio to work again (like with Mumble).Still, great sound and worth the money, especially for primarily using them on the iPhone or a Mac laptop.

"695",4,"February 4, 2016","Color: Black",TRUE,"Bose SoundLink 2 vs Plantronics BackBeat PRO...
            ","I have tried both the Plantronics BackBeat PRO and the Bose SoundLink 2 now and I am returning the Plantronics. While I prefer the technology and features of the Plantronics they are just too uncomfortable and it's a deal-breaker.Bose Pros:  Very light and around-ear comfortable.  The Bose SoundLink 2 are a little heavier than the original SoundLink but now have more integrated bluetooth (no removable adapter) and better range. I used to lose my TV connection at about 10 feet but now can go more like the full 30' advertised.Bose Cons: The Bose has limited features compared to the Plantronics and in particular really needs separate track controls.  Do you know how you skip backward with the three button Bose control?  What would you guess? Click a forward? (nope, volume) Double click forward? (nope, that would make too much sense).  You *triple click* the play / pause button.  I kid you not.  That was almost a deal breaker for me... but... I have no alternative since I can't wear the Plantronics.Bose connection issues:  Additionally, one of the Bose's cooler advertised features - the ability to remember ten devices and let you flip through them - is better in theory than in practice.  In practice the Bose seems to have problems when connected to multiple devices (e.g. phone and Mac).  And before you tell me - yes, I am using the latest firmware as of 02/2016 (more on that below).  It's not just that it stutters occasionally but worse - it seems to lose the second, inactive, connection periodically and every time it does it interrupts whatever you are doing to tell you that... So if for whatever reason (legit, e.g. distance or just flakiness) it is losing the inactive second device it gets really annoying.  Now, as a workaround it seems that you can connect to just the one device by traversing the 10 item device list a second time, but this gets very old fast since you have to listen to it speak the items one by one until you get there.Plantronics Pros: I really like the Plantronic BackBeat PROs ""open mic"" feature and the active noise cancellation as well as the fact that they have separate controls for track selection and volume.  Also the on-head detection that automatically mutes and puts the headphones to sleep when you take them off seems to work well.Plantronics Cons:  Despite what other people say about them these are definitely on-ear headphones.  They are round and rest at least partially on your ears (unless perhaps you are a child).  This combined with the fact that they are much heavier than the Bose was the deal breaker for me.  I really wanted to keep the Plantronics but I just can't wear them for more than a few minutes without being uncomfortable.  One other thing - Despite advertising advanced noise cancellation with the mic for phone calls I found that the other party did not see a significant difference between the  Plantronics and the Bose.  The Plantronics is also awkward to use for phone calls because it does not pipe any of your own voice back into the headset, so you are talking deaf essentially... This last part is very weird considering that they have that ""open mic"" functionality and obviously understand have the capability.... I just makes no sense.Both Plantronics and Bose Cons /  Wishlist (Firmware, App):I was very disappointed to see that in 2016 these advanced bluetooth devices do not yet have real apps to control them.  I was able to update the firmware and settings on my video game controller the other day just by downloading its app from the app store.  But e.g. for the Bose I had to a) traverse Bose's web site b) download their Mac app c) attach the headphones with the USB cable, and c) use a really flaky web page and native app combination to perform the update.  I did not try the Plantronics firmware update procedure (not certain if I had the newest) but I did not see an app for them in the app store either.Summary: I'm keeping the Bose and returning the Plantronics but I'm sad that there is nothing better.  If anyone knows of something else I should be comparing with please let me know.

"730",5,"January 7, 2017","Color: Black",TRUE,"Strong Wireless Headphones with a Comfy Sound and Fit
            ","If you're looking for pleasant-sounding, comfy, light wireless headphones with sensical playback and volume buttons, seriously consider Bose's Soundlink II around-ear headphones.Passive noise-cancellation on these things is fantastic. I haven't walked down a noisy street yet, but when I press play on any song at moderate volume, my environment (usually a busy home or talkative workplace) fades away. The volume gets loud enough when listening on Bluetooth, and although I've never personally wanted to go past it's max output, I'm sure there are some headbangers out there who would want a little more volume out of these things.Sound performance is gonna depend on your personal preference, but I like the balanced, detailed, open-air feeling of my music on these cans. Highs and mids come through clear to my ears, and in my opinion, these things excel with vocals. The bass is probably the most polarizing aspect of the sound signature: it's full and present, but you don't ""feel it"" the same way other headphones *cough* Beats *cough* deliver. The trade-off here is that it doesn't overpower anything, so vocals don't get washed out when the bass drops. On some tracks I wish the bass were a bit more powerful, but I still think they're on par with other wired headphones priced around $200 (and if you really miss the detail of wired sound, there's an included 3.5 mm cable). I listen mostly to alternative which employs a wide array of instruments, and I think these deliver consistently clear, strong sound across the genre.In terms of battery life, I've only charged them once in the 3 weeks I've had them, so I'm led to believe the advertised 15 hours of listening at moderate volume.The headphones themselves were smaller than I was expecting when I opened the box. They're unexpectedly light, but still feel sturdy, and it can be easy to forget they're on when you're ""in the zone."" In fact, that's one of the best features: these things are comfy, and they don't heat up my ears like how other leather ear cups do. The black version I have is low profile because it's all a matte finish instead of gloss, meaning people on the street won't point and yell at you, ""Hey everyone, they have Bose headphones!"" In other words, if you're a show-off, look elsewhere.Some people might not like the button design, but after a week, it feels more or less natural to navigate. Three small buttons, one of them depressed for feel-only operation, on the back of the right earcup control volume and playback (pause, skip, rewind, Siri) the same way Apple earphones do, and the microphones on here are entirely capable of handling phone calls.Bluetooth performance is pretty excellent, and even though it's not perfect (it'll skip when I leave the audio source and go behind a wall 20 feet away), it works well for my listening purposes. Pairing to my phone and computer was easy as could be, and everytime I turn the headphones on, my device identifies and connects within 5 seconds. Easy peasy lemon-squeezy.Lastly, the overall value: I paid $230 for the headphones on sale, and even for a college student looking to ""treat myself,"" it's a pretty hefty investment. I can't say yet if I've gotten my money's worth, but these headphones are definitely on track to prove themselves worthy. From the reviews I've read of other Bose products, I'm expecting quite a few more years of solid performance from these cans, and right now, they seem entirely up to that task.

While the headphones can be paired with several Bluetooth devices at the same time, there is no way to actively switch between said devices. What ends up happening is several devices are competing with each other.3.  This is a minor gripe, but I would love for these to charge via USB-C.

I can't complain.When you turn them on while wearing them, you can hear a digital voice tell you how much battery life remains.

            ","Comparing these to QC 25s they are replacing:They are both extremely comfortable and light. I bought the QC 25s to block out office noise but they didn't work well for voices. But for everything else like the AC and passing traffic - they were great. The Soundlinks, of course, let more sound in due to lack of ANC. The main draw for the Soundlinks was because I got fed up with the wire catching on everything I do.However, the difference in sound quality is night and day. The QC 25s were crystal clear while the Soundlinks had a faint hissing noise whenever audio played. Maybe this is a side effect of being wireless but the white noise was too distracting at low volumes.The QC 25s also have a very faint hissing noise with ANC on but not as bad as the Soundlinks. I never notice it on the QC 25s. I have sensitive hearing so your experience may differ. At mid volume, you can't hear the hiss on either but when the music gets low, you'll notice it more on the  Soundlinks.I guess if you can't deal with wires and don't mind white noise at low volumes, the Soundlinks will be great. I'll be exchanging them to see if I got a dud.

The headphones even tell you which device they're pairing with.  The batteries last a long time, too, and they are pretty long-range.  They fit around the ear so your ear isn't squished and it doesn't hurt if you wear earrings.  And because there is a hollow space around your ear, the sound is more natural, almost like being in the environment where the sound was recorded.  The only negative is that the sound isn't full and rich, and the volume isn't super high.  If I were an audiophile and listened to music seriously, I might opt for more expensive headphones with a richer sound but, for my purposes, which is mainly watching Netflix and Amazon Prime on my iPad at the gym, these suit me perfectly.  Though there are definitely more stylish headphones out there, the design of these is pretty nice, too, just a little ""plasticky.""

I have owned 2 pairs of Beats, the Studio wireless as well as the Pro.  The Bose fit much better and do not produce any discomfort on my ears.  The sound quality is what I would expect.  The main drawback would be that Bose doesn't offer a noise cancellation feature on wireless over-the-ear headphones.  But I don't find it really necessary, if you are listening to something with these on you can't hear much outside noise.  I haven't tested battery life yet, but if they last as advertised it's almost twice as long as the Beats Studio.

Slight lag while watching videos but not a deal breaker, volume overall is lower than others but noise isolation does a great job. One thing to keep in mind, when using with the included cord, the sound quality is drastically improved. Specially the treble and noticeable increase in bass. Contradicting to the above point, the cord is a proprietary one. 2.5mm to 3.5mm jack. Bluetooth connection is strong with near non existence of interference or drop in connectivity.

"842",4,"July 11, 2016","Color: Black",TRUE,"Comfy, Easy to Use, and has Convenient Action Buttons (probably not the official term :D)
            ","I bought this headset a few months ago, and I have to say that I only bought it based off of what was important to me: comfort. I was looking for a cordless over ear headphone that wouldn't get uncomfortable after too long. The reason I knew this one was okay was because I was able to try it out at Best Buy beforehand. Now, onto my experience with the connectivity, sound, and look.Worst part to me would have to be having to worry about the battery; however, you are able to plug it in with the specialized audio cable (it is not 5mm on both sides) if it dies. Once the battery does die, it does charge quickly, which doesn't make it all bad (sorry, I haven't timed it). I can't say that I've used them for more than 5 consecutive hours, but I can say that it seems like they last a while on a single battery charge. Note that you cannot use the bluetooth feature while charging (at least from when I've tried).The protein leather they stated that they use for the cushioning feels amazingly smooth. I can only wonder how long it will last, however, until the leather begins to fade and crack. No time soon, I hope!I never would have realized how great the buttons would be on the side of the headphones. They are what completes this product. Being able to pause, skip, raise/lower the volume without having to pick up my phone or open my laptop is a huge freedom for me.If you are looking to 'bass boost' you may not want these, but just know that these headphones sound, to someone who is not a snob (me), can comment that they sound fine. Also, they have decent noise cancellation even though they don't do it actively.In all, I see myself highly recommending these headphones for their comfort, ease-of-use, and convenience.EDIT: Updating this review with some findings after a couple of years. Unfortunately, they are all cons. Keep in mind these headphones have been used mildly and with care over the timespan. When it's not being used, it lives in the carrying case.Having my laptop and my phone paired at the same time and taking a call on my phone will result in choppy/studdering audio. It affects my recipients audio as well, and I must unpair my laptop to continue the call uninterrupted.The blue rubber around the edges of each cup appears to have lost their adhesive and are coming apart from the body, causing an unsightly view and a barrier to the previously praised action buttons.The soft and appealing protein leather has begun fading and cracking on both the top-bridge area as well as the cups.

            ","Finally, I got this right!!! In the past three years I've gone through about five wireless headsets. For different reasons ranging from sound quality, durability, volume issues this product surpassed my expectations.  This headset I've had for a few months now to give it time, I go just about everywhere with them. Living in a metropolitan area where the metro, subway, and long lines at the grocery store are a way of life, music helps past the time. This headset gives me great sound quality, hasn't broken, charges really fast & I must say, looks really good. If I add up all the money I've spent on less expensive wireless headsets over the past three years, I superseded the cost of this one long ago. If I had to say something bad about this headset, it would be that the sound is even better when connected with the cord that comes as an accessory; but that's not a Bose issue, that's one of limits of technology. Wireless use limits the full potential of headsets across the board. This product is worth the investment & I definitely plan on purchasing more products from this company. Rick Thumbs Up!

The bass is seriously lacking, overall everything sounds muffled & poor, & there's a fair amount of static-y noise over a certain(but still very reasonable) deceble that makes you worry this things going to blow out. 2 months in & still going strong but don't be a slave to brands like me, not worth it.

"881",3,"July 15, 2018","Color: Black",TRUE,"Hardware is unbeatable, software is lame.
            ","Okay look, the sound quality is amazing. They're super comfortable and extremely durable. Why the 3 stars? Let me give you a little background on how I use these headphones.I go to school fulltime online and code. I use my mac for school and coding. I tinker with a lot of virtual machines and play video games too, so I use my windows desktop for those things. I use a program called synergy to share my keyboard and mice between my two computers, in other words I am always swapping between my mac, pc, and phone when it comes to these headphones.The problem is switching between my devices or the random interference of using two devices at once. If you didn't know, these headphones support two Bluetooth connections at once. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN RECEIVE DATA FROM TWO PLACES AT ONCE. If you haven't guessed it, it's a pain to start receiving data from the other device that is already connected. So If I was playing video games on my pc and wanted to get back to work on my mac, which is already connected, I would normally have to either turn the headphones on and off or go into the ridiculous phone app to force disconnect the pc and connect the mac. What is the point of having two connections if you can't fast swap between receiving data from both devices? Just seems like a waste of a feature. What's worse is that there is no way to disable this. I connected bose and they said that there is no way to disable this ridiculous feature.Another annoyance is the random interfeatrance. Sometimes the headphones try to receive data from two locations causing a weird static noise or a stop and go in transmission. This problem doesn't get fixed by kicking off the devices via the app, the only way to fix this problem is to power cylce the heaphones.Besides the silly software bugs, the headphones are amazing! I travel often, and these are always by my side. The battery life is so long that you don't worry about how many hours you think you have to enjoy your headphones. They also work great for gaming. I've had several gaming dedicated headphones that lack good music sound quality. Yeah I know that's not what they're made for. But regardless, these headphones are NOT MADE FOR GAMING! Yet they still rock that area. I can hear my enemies behind me while playing overwatch with these super comfortabl heaphones. My longest time with them on was 13 hours and I did not feel any discomfort. The battery does not last 13 hours by the way, I just sometimes use them without music to quite down my surrounding so that I can work.

I mainly use mine at work, so having wired headphones wouldn't be a deal breaker, but it is nice to move around or take my headphones on and off without hassle. Note that with the bluetooth, you do lose a little bit of sound quality. But they are definitely the best bluetooth headphones in terms of sound quality as far as I know, and still better than most other headphones I've used.These are super comfortable- I can wear them for long periods of time without any issues. They can get a little warm, but that's to be expected with any around ear headphone, and it isn't that bad. A lot of similar headphones I tried were not nearly as comfortable, even for short periods of time, so the fact that these were super comfortable was a huge plus for me.The one area these can be improved is noise isolation– I get that they aren't noise canceling, but in my opinion, they don't even block out outside noise that well. If my music is loud enough, they can, but if it is even a little low (or I would say around the volume I normally have it at), I can hear conversations around me. Since finding noise canceling headphones that are also wireless is pretty hard, I think this it is a personal preference on what is more important. Since I can block out noise by turning up the volume a little (not at a deafening level by any means), I am generally fine with these but I do wish they filtered noise a bit more.The battery on these lasts a while (15 hours I think), and they charge up pretty quickly- you can even charge them for just 20 minutes and get a decent partial charge. One negative is that I don't think you can charge them while using them, and the charger it comes with is a USB cable so it needs to be plugged in to a computer. When I'm at my computer (i.e. when I would normally charge these), I usually also want to use them, so that is a drawback.Some other things:- the controls on the right ear are awesome and can be used to pause/play a song and fast forward and rewind (to either the next/previous song or within the current song). They work with iTunes out of the box, but I had to download something for them to work with Spotify on my Mac. I love these controls and use them often.-I initially had some weird issues/feedbck every time I went to a website that tried to access your microphone (such as Google which tried to do so for voice search). Switching my input microphone on my computer from the headphones to the built in mic fixed these- I didn't have issues with the skipping that a lot of people have reported but that could have been because I upgraded the software once I got my headphones- the phone quality is really good on these - I have used them for several phone interviews and they are great for that purpose

            ","I have no affiliation with Bose, or Amazon other than being a Prime member. I paid for these headphones and will receive no compensation for this review.I am a Navy veteran with years of flight deck & flight line time that compromised my hearing. I am not deaf, but I do have tinnitus and need the TV volume higher than most.  My wife has finally grown tired of putting up with it and told me that the problem had to be resolved and she did not care what it cost (Holy Grail). My TV is an older Panasonic Plasma w/o Bluetooth.I like Bose headphones, so I called the local Bose outlet and asked if they had wireless headphones (yes) and a way to connect them to my non-Bluetooth TV. He stated that they direct all of their customers to go to Amazon and purchase the Taotronics Bluetooth 4.0 Transmitter model TT-BA06. He also recommended his Bose SoundLink around-ear wireless headphones II.I made both purchases on Friday and they both arrived on Sunday at 9 am (Thanks Prime!). Perfect timing for the AFC & NFC Championship games.I had read enough reviews that Bose had responded to that recommended updating the software in the headphones, so that was the first thing I did. I let the headphones continue charging until I had a green light.I put the transmitter into pairing mode then with the head phones on I moved the selector switch into pairing mode and within 2 seconds a voice in the headphone told me it had successfully paired with the transmitter. I turned the volume on the headphones to the desired level and I was in business.I walked around the house to test the limits of the Bluetooth. Anywhere within line of sight to the transmitter in my 1600 sq ft house is within 30 feet and the connection is solid. If I have one wall between me and the transmitter within 30 feet the connection remains solid. When I put two walls between the transmitter and the headphone the connection will begin to cut out, but you can still keep up with what is being said.I am not, nor will I ever be an audiophile who can detect the most subtle nuances in sound because of my Tinnitus, BUT I am VERY finicky about lips and dialog syncing properly. I could detect NO lag, period. I am very happy with my purchase.

These Bose headphones are so far sturdier, slightly more comfortable, have better sound quality, had mic capabilities, and perhaps are also more sleek looking than the cheap ones.  Also, they weighed similarly to the cheap ones (No batteries needed for both).  No doubt the Bose headphones are better, but...Just judging by the degree to which the Bose headphones are better, I'd say It's overpriced by at least $50 at the time of writing.

These headphones do not produce the sound quality that I am used to from Bose.  These sound very flat across the board.  I was expecting way better sound quality especially at this price point.  I've been a Bose fan for a long time and am usually amazed at the quality of audio they can produce from their products.  But lately not so much.  I recently purchased the Bose Soundsport wired version of their earphones and had a similar experience.  The sound quality from those was subpar as well.  So I returned them.  This is what I did with these Soundlink's as well.  They went right back after hearing these headphones.  The build quality seemed ok, they were light and comfortable but a little cheap feeling overall.  But I would have lived with the build if the sound was old Bose, however sound quality was not even close.  With all the competition out there in this around ear wireless headphone segment I cannot recommend these.

            ","I love the comfortability, lightness and design of these headphones. They are a joy to wear and you can wear them for as long as the battery lasts to be honest and not get fatigued I felt. I do wish they had the option of sitting a little tighter on the head so that they don't fall off but after getting a headache from using beats solo on a plane ride it was a good respite. As soon as I turned them on I realized that the volume of the headphones is very low. I find myself having to turn the volume up to the 4th highest setting just to reach the minimum audible level of anything that I'm watching. I have MPOW and Sony Ericson headphones that I bought for 20 dollars each that deliver higher volumes and better bass. This should never be the case going up against a $250(after taxes) pair of headphones. I also noticed that when using the cord to connect the headphones to any of my devices the volume doubles in capacity. I think that these are wired headphones that Bose has implemented bluetooth technology with to enter the market. These headphones do not meet the standards that Bose has maintained with the public. While the sound quality may or may not be to their standard, I couldn't tell because I never got the volume loud enough without the cord, I can say the bass is of a lower quality, these headphones seem to be better suited for certain kinds of music (emphasis on pure vocals ) and less geared to House, edm, techno, hip-hop, pop basically anything that is bass or volume dependent. I plan on returning these and trying the QC35s, I hope they represent Bose much more favorably as I have always respected Bose as top tier audio company.

Nothing comes close to how comfortable these things are. Battery life is ridiculously good. Call quality is excellent. They store into a very nice, thin case making them VERY convenient for travel.

            ","To start nice headphones, Good sturdy build, pretty easy overall use and setup for most connections. Typical bose bassy sound (which I like).The bad...connectivity is inconsistent and problematic when switching between pairing with 3 or 4 devices (masx2 at a time). You are using them while paired to your phone and your laptop is 60 ft away and you get a message every time it goes in and out (so every 30 seconds)""connecting to device LT_12543-pc"", ""disconnecting blah blah"" .The only way to stop this is to unpair which via the headphones alone is difficult if not impossible sometimes so you have to find the other device and turn off it bluetooth. But then you have to repair when you want to use with your laptop.....which as I said is not so bad but then you have to remember unpair if you don't want to run into the in and out situation mention previous.  But the final demise....on the 100th time or so I have paired to my laptop it asks for a PIN code. There is no PIN code for these...get google machine going, lots of examples, no solution. Call bose tech support, you know the drill. Reset, reboot, pair to 4 other things but not laptop - ""so it works"" they declare,  ""no it doesn't"" I reply.  Then it's please hold and a call to second level tech support is made... a minute later they come back. This is a common issue with windows 10 you have these options1. ""you should call microsoft tech support or Lenovo (laptop OEM)""....ya right they are all over 3rd party device support..2  We send you a 'brand new' pair ......of course only after I send old pair back(they pay to ship) + 10 days for new to be sent after they receive old. She included this interesting statement - ""if the new ones don't pair with my LT it's my fault""I ask for a 3rd option, return for refund. That a no go.So this is all fine if I paid 50$, but these are 280$ headphone. I paid that price because I paid for them to work in all common use cases (this wasn't I couldn't get them to connect to my custom raspberry pi dishwasher controller I cooked up). This is connecting to a current win10 OS on a <1 year old 2000$ lenovo laptop. I paid 280$ for Bose to make something that works consistently and easily, I paid 280$ for bose to make sure windows or lenovo don't push drivers that screw their products.(which isn't the case I haven't updated LT in 2 months). All in all, these are a fail unless you want to pair to a single device, in that case I think they'd be great. Wire suck.

If you choose the stereo headphone, then you will be rewarded with a rich, Bose experience.When you are listening to your computer and a call comes in, it switches to the phone and you an operate the call.  That whole experience is freaking awesome and holds SO much promise.  HOWEVER, it does have software issues:- The mic quality is very hit or miss.  I feel like on higher quality Skype calls, it can perform very well.  On regular phone calls, the mic quality goes down substantially and the audio in the speakers also drops considerably.  I tested with my wife and switched between the Bose, the iPhone mic, and a cheap pair of SkullCandy headphones with a boom mic.  The Bose performed worse than the phone mic and the $50 SkullCandy set was substantially better in voice quality than both.  That is a bummer as I do a lot of conference calls and do not want to deal with voice muffling and in/out sound.- I paired it with both my computer and phone.  When playing high quality audio from my computer, I had problems that others reported with audio going in and out or suffering some kind of interference.  I turned off all 2.4GHz wireless internet and still had a problem.  On the first day I used these, I did not have this problem at all.  On the second day, I had nothing but this problem.  Deleted the configs, re-paired everything and still had the problem.The phones are really comfortable.  Tired of black headphones, I got the white ones.  I was a bit worried that it might not look quite manly enough, but they look really sharp and was happy with my color choice.I really think that this could be a fantastic, 10-star product once they fix the software.  Until then, I give it 4-stars and have to return them as I can't live with these problems.

            ","This headset wins on comfort, quality, look's. Its great being able to connect multiple Bluetooth devices at once to the unit.

            ","I was amazed at the sound quality and clarity when I first received and tried out these headphones. Bose certainly lives up to their reputation and experience when it comes to audio sound. I had previously bought a different brand ""comparable to Bose"", slightly less expensive, but I rarely used them as the volume wasn't loud enough even turned up to the highest setting, and they hurt my ears after just a short period of time. These are extremely comfortable, very lightweight, and  the Bluetooth connects quickly. If my husband is watching television or listening to the radio in the car, I can use them to play my music or watch online movies and they drown out the background noise. The only complaint I have is the USB charging cable is way too short and I have to use an extension cord. This makes it somewhat inconvenient-especially when traveling. I do plan on purchasing a longer cord, but for the cost of the product I feel like I shouldn't have to take an extension cord with me or spend additional money to buy a longer one. Overall though, I'm extremely happy with them and I would certainly recommend investing in Bose.

Would I Master with these? Heck, no - but I *could* if I had to. They bump the bass and roll off the very high highs - e.g. they are ""tuned"" for their application, which is, uh, listening to compressed MP3 files via a Bluetooth connection. How snobby do I need to be?!Well, the truth is that I spent some nontrivial money on other BT headphones, all of which sounded like crap. So, considering my experience with previous Bose phones, I decided just to drop the coin and get a set of these. And y'know what? ""Quality is remembered long after Price is forgotten"".

The sound is so pristine, it's something you'll have to hear for yourself to fully comprehend.Now you're probably wondering why I only gave them 4/5 stars? The reason being is because I can't wirelessly connect them to my Toshiba CB35-B3340 Chromebook.I'm not sure if there a software update out there that will help me with this, but whenever I check for Bluetooth devices within range of my Chromebook I see these headphones but as soon as I click on them to pair up, it says, ""Failed to connect to '08:DF:1F:54:1C:74'.""I was really hoping to be able to connect to my laptop wirelessly, but now I'm not sure it is even possible.If there is a way to fix this issue then I will gladly change this review to 5/5 stars, but in all, these are the best headphones I have ever purchased and most likely will ever purchase (unless it's a new pair of Bose).Great job, Bose!

            ","Bought these for my husband for a Valentine's Day present. I also have the older version of these. They work great with excellent sound quality. The downside is that they aren't very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I wear them for phone calls or listening to music but immediately take them off when I'm not using them. So if you're looking for some that you can wear all day, these aren't for that. But the Bluetooth is clear on calls and the sound quality is excellent for music. Even though they aren't noise cancelling, the around the ear does cancel out some background noise. If I'm on the phone, I pretty much can't hear anything in my immediate background.

Like I said, they mostly work and you don't need a battery to power on the headset.The internal battery last 2-3 days and the headphones charge relatively quick.My only frustration. Bose decided to take a cord that only works with this headphones. So if a computer doesn't have a Bluetooth sensor, you'll have to use the 8in cord provided. I wouldn't say it's the sturdiest though.Overall I'm mostly happy with them except for the cheap cord that's provided.

            ","The Bluetooth sound quality is what you have come to expect from Bose, which is to say, superb. There is no noticeable delay in the audio when wearing the headphones unless you can also hear the sounds from the TV that are outside the headsets. For reasons I don't understand, this is not a constant problem and I find it only a slight annoyance when it is present. After awhile, I hardly notice it. Even then, it does not appear as a delay as much as it does an echo. Lip movement from the TV picture and the sound appears normal.  I can wear the headphones anywhere in my house, including outside on my screened porch where I do all of my grilling and never lose sound. How cool! When the headsets are first turned on, a voice tells you the percentage of charge left in the battery. I wish it also did when I turned the headset off, so I could determine if the battery needed charging overnight. The answer to this problem is to turn them back on for a second, listen for the charge information and then turn them off again. I dropped 1 star because the battery cannot be changed without sending the headset back to Bose and paying them to replace the battery with you paying shipping both ways. It isn't cheap and somewhat makes these expensive headsets "" throw- a- ways"". Being a long time Bose customer, I have come to expect more out of this company. This is a major issue and I hope this does not become a norm with Bose. If it does, I will have to look elsewhere for my next audio purchase. Bose, please take note. I am sure there are many more like me that feel the same way that I do. You are Bose after all!

I've tried the Bose QuietComfort series, but unfortunately I'm one of those individuals who finds active noise cancellation physically uncomfortable. So I found myself trying the SoundLink II as an alternative.These are Bluetooth headphones, which is a nice plus—no cords getting in the way of your in-flight meal or tripping your fellow passengers. The Bluetooth ""just works."" It couldn't be easier. The audio quality is just fine, and there's no discernible lag when watching a movie via iTunes. I'm completely sold on Bluetooth for travel headphones. You can use them with a cord, too (say, for that in-flight entertainment system). The cord is helpfully included in a pocket in the carrying case, along with the charging cable.Everything about this product is very well thought-out. There's no extraneous packaging. The zippered carrying case is lightweight and compact. The cups have large, clear ""R"" and ""L"" labels inside. When you turn them on, the headphones tell you the name of the device they're currently connected to. And so on. In short, these are a superb product. I highly recommend them to anyone who travels frequently and doesn't like active noise cancellation.

The noise isolation was mediocre at best and the comfort for longer wearing periods was not too great. Connectivity posed few issues however. Other than that and the design being pretty great, I'd say that Bose's claim for this being a good pair of headphones is false (the low end is shallow, the midtones are muddy, while the high end is the only positive factor).

            ","[Updated After a few days of use]After tinkering and testing another highly rated bluetooth headphone (Jabra Move) I'm upgrading my initial rating. The bluetooth sound management is not necessarily a fault of Bose but rather crapy sound management from Apple devices.Older review (not valid for only Bose although the situation is still there):This thing simply doesn't know how to manage multiple bluetooth devices. I have my iPhone and Mac connected and when I press play in the device, it decides to run audio on the Mac. If I pause the audio there and try to play ANYTHING on the iPhone, no sound would come through unless I completely disconnect the Mac. So it doesn't take multiple devices and switching is a best cumbersome.The audio quality is a hit or miss. If the app has some sort of equalizer, then you can bring levels to something decent, if not, then expect to listen to everything as if it passed through a tin can.Worth the money? Don't think so. The only saving capability is that battery life is decent.Summary:Sound: Mediocre (and I have other 2 Bose speakers at home)Bluetooth battery: GoodBluetooth management: Bad, really bad.

            ","I recently purchased the BOSE Quiet Comfort 15 and short of ordering the Bowers & Wilkins P5 I decided to give these a go. It is clear that one is buying the wireless and fast charging technology in this device. There is a clear sound difference between these and the QC15. However, the higher treble tones as opposed to the lacking deeper BASS tones are a welcome aspect vs the prior. I use both sets for the gym and am currently playing Junior Boys, electronic and metal (Megadeth) to workout in. So, these are amazing. The leather and padding for the ears are not a super high quality but, the ly suffice. The main advantage is the lack of wire, super fast iPhone sync and amazingly rapid battery recharging time. That's where you get your money's worth. The battery indicator lights and iphone-headphone-like remote on the earpiece are wonderfully convenient.  I can answer calls, skip songs, repeat songs, etc etc just like the stock iPhone headphones just, these are built right into the bottom of the right ear piece. Again, very convenient.  There is a nice voice prompt that tells you how much battery life is left and where the device is connected to - this comes on upon turning the headphones on. With the QC15, I found the VERY LONG wire associated to the device highly annoying as they would routinely bother me during reps... even when wound up and tucked. However, again the QC15 had a superior sound quality. But, again, the wire was such a hassle. And battery replacement was a drag. Hands down and the noise cancellation was great with the QC15, given the cling and clang of the gym. However, bottom line, I am well pleased with what I have in these wireless BOSE. I will try the B&W at some point. But if I wait for next year's model, it won't surprise me. Very happy with the BOSE Soundlink.

These headphones should be priced between $59-$79 because that's the quality range they are in.

I tested it out over the Christmas weekend after receiving it only to find that it is defective.On Bluetooth, the left earphone emits a loud cracking and buzzing sound. You can update the firmaware, reboot your mobile home and earphones but the sound just makes you angry. This is a recurring problem with all Bose wireless headphones, especially with iPhones which is a huge problem because all the new iPhone models are wireless and don’t have headphone jacks. Online reviews from buyers indicate that they go through 4-5 returns before getting one that doesn’t crackle or buzz incessantly in the left earphone.In all customer service queries I have found online, Bose’s customer service always suggests trying another device to connect to or contacting customer service.This is suppose to be a quality product and the problem seems to be widespread with all Bose wireless headphones, not just this but the latest model too. Yet the manufacturer has failed to provide solutions beyond “connect to another device” and blaming the buzzing, crunching, loud crackling sound to interference from other signals and Apple products?This experience completely turned me off Bose for life. They seem to be set against innovation or adapting to digital disruptions that alter user behavior. Telling users to change to another device isn’t good business sense when your overpriced headphones don’t sound as good as cheap $20 in-ear ones and also have a very high incidence of quality control issues with sound problems that Bose seems to be aware of but hasn’t made efforts to correct over multiple iterations of their line of wireless headphones.

"1729",1,"October 27, 2015","Color: White",TRUE,"Bluetooth is still a disaster. Avoid it.
            ","The Good:The headset is comfortable and very light weight.  It looks nice and feels solidly made (with the exception of the on/off switch, which feels flimsy)The Bad:The state of bluetooth pairing is still miserable. I last tried bluetooth nearly 5 years ago, and I'd heard lots of good things about the bt4 protocol solving problems.  It has gotten *slightly* better, but is still completely unusable if you plan on moving this headset between more than 1 device (and often, even when using just one device).problem 1: Applications crash when the headset leaves range.No, I'm not joking.  Watching netflix with this headset and you want to grab a beer from the fridge? Chrome will crash when the headset drops connectivity.  I don't have this problem with any of the other (actual wireless and not bluetooth junk) headsets I use.problem 2: Device will attempt to connect to devices that are not in range.Paired this with my desktop at home and my laptop at work, it will endlessly try to connect to my desktop at work. repeating ""connecting to 'computer host name'"" over and over again until I wipe all paired devices.problem 3: I cannot use the high quality stereo sound connection while using the mic.For some reason the device completely changes profiles when you have an application that's using its mic input.  It starts doing mic passthrough (you hear the mic input through the speakers) and drops the sound quality down to roughly a shoddy cellphone level of quality. I don't mind the passthrough, I understand it's helpful so you're not accidentally yelling on the subway while on a call, but the drop in sound quality is simply terrible. I'm honestly not sure whether it's a limitation of the bluetooth stack, or a problem with the device.  Either way, for 300 dollars, I expect to be able to use high quality sound output while I'm using the microphone, and I expect the headset to respect the audio settings I have configured for default input and output in windows.To elaborate, because this issue is really, really a dealbreaker: I have a significant other who lives long distance for school.  We watch netflix while on skype several times a week.  I cannot get sound from netflix and from skype at the same time, because skype is using the handsfree connection, and netflix is using the high quality stereo sound.  I don't even know if Bose is at fault here (it might well be a crappy bluetooth stack in win10) I don't care.  If that's the case, freaking let me pair two separate devices (one as a microphone, one as a headphone) and stop with the shoddy handsfree crap.Problem 4: It's getting worse.I figured I'd upgrade to the latest firmware to see if it resolved any of the problems I was having.  I successfully updated and now I only receive audio output while using my macbook in the left ear.  Holy **** Bose.  Problem doesn't happen while using windows or android, just the macbook.  It worked fine (fine meaning all above problems were present and it was an absolute nightmare, but at least nothing felt outright broken) before the firmware upgrade.Final thoughts: If you want a hideously overpriced headset you will only ever use with your phone (and just 1 phone) then this headset fits the bill.  It looks nice, feels decent, and is light and compact.If you want to do *anything* else with it, go buy a different product.  I'd advise steering clear of bluetooth altogether.

I ended up returning them and buying Sony, which also didn't work.After a lot of research, I found that the only bluetooth drivers that work for headphones with Windows is the Broadcom.  So, I bought a Broadcom based usb dongle (the Plugable from here on Amazon), installed the bluetooth drivers from the Broadcom site, and everything started working perfectly.But my daughter absconded with the Sony headset, so I decided to try the Bose again, as I wasn't 100% satisfied with the Sony sound quality.

"1741",1,"June 1, 2017","Color: Black",TRUE,"Terrible for gaming
            ","After owning this product for almost half a year, I must say that I am very disappointed.To be clear, my primary use case is online PC gaming. It is entirely likely that this is a great headset for audiophiles who are connecting to their phone.First off, the out-of-box experience is terrible. When I first turned them on, my PC detected two Bose AE2 soundlink devices which were only differentiated by the icon to the left of the device. With no clear instructions, I naively selected the first one(With a TV and iPod in the image). This was apparently the wrong choice as they refused to work at all. After several hours of reading forums and searching for solutions, I found out that I had to un-pair them and select the second option(with the headphone picture) instead. I've attached a screenshot with the two images in case anyone is curious.After that was resolved, I started up Overwatch to try them out. When I got in-game, Overwatch immediately crashed. After another few hours of searching, I found out that this is a known issue affecting multiple games, and is documented on the Overwatch forums.It seems that this headset is not capable of producing both HIGH QUALITY audio and receiving microphone input at the same time. For normal voice calls, that doesn't matter, but for gaming, the audio is a key component of the experience.I was able to play games if I used the headset for EITHER audio OR mic, but I had to have either another set of speakers or another mic for it to work.Realizing that this was a limitation of Bluetooth, I decided to try wiring my headset to the PC.Unfortunately, the USB cable is for charging only, the audio cable doesn't work concurrently with Bluetooth, and the audio cable also does not accept mic input.All-in-all, this headset completely failed at my primary use case, and now I have to go spend $60-$100 on another pair of headphones while these will rot in a drawer somewhere.

"1742",5,"December 15, 2017","Color: White",FALSE,"I did not buy them from Amazon; however, I thought I'd leave a review here for the people that are unsure in what to buy.
            ","I recently bought these headphones at BestBuy for several reasons and I'll mention those later in the review. However, you must know what YOU value most in a pair of headphones as that could be the deciding factor in which ones you end up buying. I will be reviewing several things in this headphones like, comfort, sound, quality, comparison to other Bose products, and its features. This review is MY opinions so keep that in-mind, now let's get started.Comfort: 5/5Out of all the headphones out there, there are several good ones in terms of comfort; however, for me there was no comparison when it came to the Bose products like these, Bose SoundLink, QuickComfort 25, and QuickComfort 35. All three of these and some other Sony products had great comfort. However, I found that the Bose blew it out of the water with comfort. I've been wearing these headphones for over 6 hours and I feel no discomfort like I did in other pairs. Comfort was a top priority for me as I'm a web development study and I spend hours a day on my computer programming and listening to music, etc...Sound: 5/5I personally give these headphones a 5/5 on sound. Compared to the QuickComfort 25, I found that these have BETTER sound. Now, of course there are headphones out there with more bass, but for me, I found that the bass it had was just perfect and if the QuickComfort had more I'd say they would be similar. When listening to these headphones, you can notice that the bass, highs, lows, etc... are all even. Meaning one doesn't out do the other making a great and comfortable listening experience. I mainly listen to Spanish music, Rap, Hip-Hop, etc... And I've found these to work great for all those people wondering if it could be enough bass. It is perfect.Quality: 5/5Just like the QC 25 and the new version 35, they have the exact same quality built in them. They don't feel cheap at all unlike Beats for an example. I feel if you are going to pay $200 and more, headphones should be getting out of the plastic range where Beats used ALL plastic. No need to go further into quality. Trust me, the quality is great and is going to last awhile.Features: 5/5Now, remember when buying these that these DON'T have noise-canceling features. However, for me I felt it didn't need any as the volume was a little louder compared to the QC 25. When playing music I couldn't hear my roommate's Bose speaker that was playing very loud. Now, these also do lead a bit, but not as much as others I've noticed. I also really like the Bluetooth that it had. I can connect two devices which is really nice. I connected straight out of the box within minutes and started listening to my favorite tones. I also really like the volume control feature it has and the buttons on the side. The lady's voice is also nice when I pair to a device. Also, what really surprised me was the microphone on this thing. Wow, Just wow. I called my mom to test it and half way through I told her I was using my headphones and she was also surprised saying that it sounded like I was just talking normally on the phone. So, if you're on your phone a lot it's nice. It did come with two cords. One an AUX cord (it has a 2.5mm unlike most headphones) and the other a charging cable for charging these. Yes, it does come with a rechargeable battery which is super nice and compared to the QC 25, they used AAA batteries which could cost you the amount of the headphones over time. The charge can last up to 15 hours and with 15 minutes of charge you can expect up to 2 hours of listening.OVERALL: 5/5Over these headphones were MORE than enough for me and I'm sure happy that I decided to buy these. I love the case it also came in and it seemed very good quality. Now if you're looking into buying the QC 35, just remember that these are $200 and the QC 35's are $350, which is a lot. Just remember when deciding on which headphones to buy, just think to yourself, ""What will I be using these for?"" and if what I want in a headphone match up with what I'm buying! Good luck and hope this helps.-- I also forgot to mention that I'm 21 years old. So, yes... I am a millennial and I was looking at the one-star reviews on here and no offense to them (maybe it really wasn't working) but you know how older people are that didn't grow up around technology, everything is a struggle for them. I feel as if you have common computer skills that you shouldn't have HALF the problems that these lower reviews has. And a quick sorry to all my older people out there that I offended just now (and if you are, don't... that's how things are).

"1753",4,"September 25, 2015","Color: Black",FALSE,"Overall, a solid pair of headphones
            ","After Bose about a year Bose introduced their AE2W bluetooth headphones, (the previous model to the Soundlink Around Ear 2) I decided to wait for an updated model.  The AE2W were bulky to me and the battery life was not impressive for only being 7 hours.  However, I am pretty surprised with Bose's new headphones, the Soundlink Around Ear 2 (which i'll abbreviate with SLAE2) . First, these headphones are going to be used in my house primarily or when doing light travel.  If you are looking for a new pair of headphones made for noise cancellation, please look at Bose's QC25 noise cancellation headphones.  The SLAE2 do what is called passive noise cancellation which means the physical cups of the headphones block noise, similar to the red working headphones lawn crews use to block out lawn mowers.  For this review, I will have two sections: the pros and cons of the headphones.First, Lets start with the negatives of the headphones: the price.  For $279, that is a pretty steep price.  Now whether you can find better headphones for $279, that is debatable.  Unlike most people, when it comes to audio, I tend to only buy Bose.  Now, is that naive of me?  Probably, however, after building trust with the Bose company, it is very hard for  me to go anywhere else. At least you always know that you are buying a solid product no matter what they bring to the market.  The next con is audio loss while streaming over bluetooth. While using bluetooth, I noticed the headphones did not get as high in volume whenever I used the bluetooth.  On the other hand, when you use the 3.5mm cable, the volume almost gets twice as high.  Unfortunately, that is one of the negatives of bluetooth.  While bluetooth can be very convenient, you have to take a loss in performance. But remember, this is Bose after all, so the loss is not as bad as other manufactures.  They still sound great though no matter how you listen to music!The last con is with my Macbook. I noticed that while listening to music through bluetooth, the audio seems to very quickly skip once and a while.  I plan to call Apple and discuss this issue because it only happens with my Mac and not any other devices.Now for the positives of this product. The overall quality of this product is superb. The materials, case and even cables are hands down quality.  The battery life is 15 hours and is true because I tested it and even got a bit more listening at a lower volume.  The case included is soft, but durable so the headphones should be safe in their case.Overall, if you want a wireless pair of headphones that have long battery life and can produce music in an excellent way, you should not be please.  Just remember they are bluetooth after all, so you might notice a very small decrease in quality.  Hooray to Bose for making a great product again!

            ","I purchased these recently from Crutchfield but sharing my review here too. I ordered these because I have tried several around-ear and over-ear headphones and have not found any that have been comfortable for glasses wearers like myself. My Beats Solo 2 are too uncomfotable on the ears after about 60 min of wear. These were very light and comfortable, but the sound was not what I would expect from $280 Bose headphones. Good hi-freq, ok medium freq, but terrible bass, with a generally plastic/tinny sound.Pros- Lightweight compared to my Beats Studio 2 Wireless and Sony MDR wired headphones- Comfortable to wear with glasses- Bluetooth with 3.5mm backup for usage even when battery is dead- Pairing was simpleConsWhere to begin...- Very little bass. This was my chief complaint. I tried several sources and both wired and bluetooth usage but found the sound quality to  be far worse than even my Beats, and they don't have a particularly great rep compared to Bose as is.* C at best on audio quality. *- It's lightweight, but the headphones feel very cheap. Compared to my beats which have smooth luxiorious leather ear muffs, these have cheap looking crinkled leather muffs. They also have a clunky plastic head band with multiple screw holes that aren't even capped or covered. Finally, the big power button on the side of the right ear muff and bright lights for battery and bluetooth status are tacky. They don't even fold up completely so you have to carry around a fairly large case.* D+ on industrial design, only scoring points for light weight.- I used the Bose Connect iPhone app to update the firmware out of the box. It took over an hour just to download the software update. WUT?! See attached screenshot. My iPhone 7 was on my home wifi (fiber), and my speed test app confirmed that my phone was getting 187mb down at the time so this must have been one heck of a firmware update.  To make matters worse, if you plug in the headphones to charge or disconnect them from your iPhone (even if you walk out of the room with your phone..) the download stops and needs to be restarted! Why not let me download your clunky firmware update to my phone first and then send it to the device later? Software update out of the box was impossible because the headphones only arrived with 45% charge, also disappointing for a ""high end"" device.* F on usability *- I tried contacting Bose support to see if you could adjust the EQ/bass balance on these (through the otherwise useless Bose Connect app, perhaps?) but they work bankers hours on east coast. So by the time I was leaving work at 5pm Pacific, they were closed. And they're only open Mon-Fri. I guess they don't care about west coast customers who have day jobs. That's a pretty big segment of the population...* F on support*- USB charging cable is only 6 inches long so if your laptop is on a lift/stand or if you use a wall adapter (not included, buy your own I guess..?) they will dangle down and put a lot of tension on the very flimsy port and thin cable.Overall, very disappointed in these and would not try another set of Bose headphones again. I am returning these to the original retailer and trying some Bowers & Wilkins headphones instead, as recommended by a friend.

The sound quality is superb and balanced.  If you are ""all about that bass"" then these may not be your cup of tea.  They have plenty of bass, but excellent sound quality is more than just bass but also the balance and separation of the bass, midrange, and treble.  If you want to enjoy all types of music at normal volumes then you will not be disappointed.  The build quality is admittedly ""plasticy"" as some have said.  For a $200 set of headphones, we might expect more.  But this may be the reason that they are so darn light that you forget you're wearing them.  Unlike other headphones I own, you can wear these for hours on end without ear fatigue or soreness.  Because they don't clamp down hard on your head I can see where they would not be the best choice for physical activity.  Leave them at home and take the ear buds to the gym and jogging.

We own all three and I had the time to really sit and listen to music. The kind of music with instruments and all and artists that want their music to be works of art. I love almost all genres of music and can appreciate genres that I do not really like. But I love the acoustic guitar, steel guitar, drums well almost all the instruments. I love country, blues, rock and 70's and 80's music and I want to hear all the music the way it should be heard. I grew up with a father who had a stereo room, and played the guitar. I love live music and I have a very picky ear. I have been a Beats fan mostly because I got sick of crappy earbuds that always left me dissatisfied. My husband bought me My first Beats Solo 2 Headphones and they sound good, but still a little lacking I guess what they call the ""mid-range"". and my Solo's squeezed the S@!! out my head and the ear pads didn't cover my ears. I have to take my earrings out and still end up in pain. While the Beats Studio wireless at the price of $379.00 are much more comfortable but still lacking in the instrument mid range. Now I put these things on and put on one of my favorite artists (Kenny Chesney) :)  that I know that he has a lot of guitar, piano, drums etc. and I could hear it all, the music was so different so clear and so beautiful. I think the way music is supposed be heard. I consider myself a music snob, but do not listen to a lot of hip hop (I think the music Beats had in mind while designing their product) maybe this is why I think these things (Bose) are amazing and I mean AMAZING. I did a side by side of several artists with different genres and Bose stand out by a long shot. Beats sorry I am switching to the other side.BTW these are very comfortable too, I have not used them as my phone and could not tell you the call quality.

I usually have them connected to my iPhone and iPad simultaneously, and switch back and forth as I use the two devices. It's very simple to use. There is also an app that you can get for iPhone and iPad that lets you control the headphones.

They do generate a bit more heat than on-ear headphones which I owned previously, but nothing too problematic unless you have very long/thick hair and/or you have a warm room.  The sound quality is excellent; outside noise is close to nil; and static or fade or dropped audio is practically non-existent.  The phones fully-charge in about 90 minutes from my PC, probably faster from a direct wall charger.I highly recommend the Bose SoundLink Bluetooth headphones.  They are pricey, and you might be able to get 90% of the performance for 50% (or less) of the price, but I've had Bose products from the 1990's and the quality and longevity of the products is worth the premium price.  You'll get many years of use out of the headphones and if you have a top-quality HDTV, it pays to spend a few $$$ to get quality.As for using the Bose SL with laptops, iPads, smartphones, etc.:  they work nicely with those too, but I bought these almost exclusively for TV listening.  There's a short mic cord for use with those products.Oh yeah: make sure you buy a $30 Bluetooth transmitter (NOT a receiver) if your TV or audio system doesn't have built-in Bluetooth unless you want to use a lengthy cord (which kind of defeats the purpose of buying wireless, right?).

My in-ear $20 headphones do the job just fine, ugh - but I guess you pay for the convenience and technology that went into building these.Visited Best Buy multiple times to test multiple floor models - Beats/Bose/Sony/JBL etc. Initially went with the Bose Soundlink ""On Ear"" version as I believe they sound slightly better than the ""Over Ear"" version and were a smaller profile with same Battery life. IMO clarity is identical to the ""Around Ears""but the ""On Ear's"" had just a tad bit more bass that was just right. Not crazy bass'y* but just right. Eventually returned the ""Bose On Ear"" as the padding would flatten out after hours of use and hurt my ears.Traded in for the Sony's Wireless - MDR XB950BT/B - Get these if you like Hard hitting/Head rattling bass and don't care about clarity much, $100 cheaper with A LOT more bass. I had these for a few days and returned them- music wasn't as clear and sometimes overshadowed by the Bass. Important-Call quality on the other end was said to sound muffled-could tell I was on a headset or wireless.

            ","So let me start by saying I don't own one yet.  The wife is getting me one for our anniversary.  Last night she brought her co worker's Beats over the ear wireless headphones and Bose soundlink II around the ear headphones home for me to compare.  I tried them both for about 3-4 hours going back and forth between the two with my iphone 6 and laptop with windows 10. While on the laptop I tried them with my music in itunes and also a couple different action movies.While listening to music on my laptop the Beats were very loud and definitely had some booming base.  When I put on the Bose I noticed I had to turn the volume up higher to reach the same sound level as the Beats.  The Bose were a lot more clear and crisp then the Beats and the highs, mids and lows seemed to be a lot more balanced.  It seemed that the Bose had more stereo sound as opposed to the Beats which sounded more monotone.Next I tried both headphones with a couple different movies on the laptop.  For this I didn't notice much of a difference between the two.  Both had excellent sound and this time the volume levels seemed to be closer to each other.On my iphone 6 the volume level also seemed to be a lot closer than when I tried them with itunes in my laptop.  There was a difference though in quality of sound.  The Beats had heavy base but the overall sound was more monotone.  The Bose had more equal balance and sounded more like I was in a concert. The Beats are noise cancelling but the Bose are not.  To be honest I thought the Bose kept the outer noise out about as good as the Beats.  Maybe a better test would be on a plane but my private jet is in the shop so this was impossible.  I definitely couldn't hear the wife when she was talking to me with either headphone so that might be a huge selling point for a lot of you guys!As far as comfort goes they were both comfortable but I'd give a big edge to the Bose.  The Beats fit snug and the ear pads seem to still lie on the edges of my ears (and no I don't have big ears). Although comfortable while I was testing it, I could see this being a problem after several hours and begin to hurt.  Just a guess on my part.  The Bose on the other hand fit perfectly around my ears and were the most comfortable headphones I've ever tried on.  It also didn't squeeze my head as the Beats did.  Possibly because the Bose headphones adjust off of the actual headband when the Beats do not.  This causes the Beats to put more pressure on the bottom of the earpiece when the Bose have more even pressure all around the ear.They were both very light so I thought I'd test them by jumping up and down and wildly moving my head side to side (causing my wife to make fun of me all night.  Along with the jokes about how I tested these headphones out more than I test drove my car when I bought it).  Both stayed on my head without me having to adjust them which was very impressive to me.  I'm thinking I'll be able to use it at the gym when my wireless Monster iSports run out of juice.  I didn't really try the buttons too much since I was more concentrating on the sound and comfort.My conclusion: If you want loud sound and base that's louder than the highs and mids then the Beats are definitely for you.  Some people might want that but not me.  The Bose were crisp and clear.  All levels of music were well balanced.  When I say that the Beats were louder than the Bose, don't get me wrong, just turn the Bose up a little more and they can get very very loud.  I never had to turn the volume up all the way because the sound got to be too loud before having to do so.  Also, the base was plenty heavy when the song was a base heavy song.  The Bose also wins when it comes to comfort.  I can see wearing it for hours and hours without that pain made from pressure against the ear or head.The only thing I think the Beats ""beats"" the Bose on is the various colors that it comes in.  Although the Bose look great, the Beats have a better look and you have a lot more choices to fit your liking.  This is a minor thing though because, as I said, the Bose do look great. Oh also they both paired very quickly to both my iphone and laptop.I'll try to have an update after I receive my own Bose headphones.  They should be in today (thanks Amazon Prime!).

I tried the latest Bose Quietcomfort NC, Seinheiser, Sony MDR 1A, V Moda Crossfade, Beats Studio, AudioTechnica NC, Parrot etc. Initially I was only looking for ones with noise cancellation and tried the listed pairs. But no headphone with active noise cancellation was comfortable after 1 hour of listening. My ears started paining. May be because of the white noise. All other headphones than Bose did not have neutral sound. Because of forward MID equalizer settings in others, they were not pleasant to the ears. But when I tried Bose Quietcomfort NC, I thought this is with best sound quality and ANC; so my search for perfect headphones was over. But I used them on long hour flights and soon I got disappointed because of ear pain due to ANC. Then finally, I wet back to this Bose soundlink Bluetooth headphones deciding that I don't need noise cancellation at the cost of comfort. And now I am completely happy with these pairs. You can hear almost all sort of sounds on these. Especially I hear lot of country, pop and Bollywood music which uses plethora of musical instruments. These headphones sound quality is always were smooth and pleasant to the ears be it any sort of instrument at any frequency. The next best I thought was Sony MDR 1A, but they leaked a lot. Hence, if you are looking for most perfect around the ear headphones with great sound quality for all kinda genres; with minimum leakage this is the best bet. Believe me, I tried all mentioned headphones and more for a period of 3 months and then comes my conclusion. So better save yourself the research headache and time, and get these! cheers!

            ","Wow.I had been using Bose AE2 headphones for many years; the same pair in fact.  I had to order a pair of aftermarket ear pads for them (cost about $20) but they still work wonderfully.  It should be said that I use my AE2 headphones 5 days per week, up to 6 hours per day, and have been doing so for three plus years.Sorry this sounds like a review for the AE2s, but I feel it adds something to the quality of my new cordless, Bluetooth headphones by noting the reliability and quality of previous versions of Bose products.These headphones are somehow better than the AE2s, but include the added features of being Bluetooth, cordless.  They are comfortable to wear just like the AE2s, and the sound is better I think.I didn't need new phones.  I bought these kinda on a whim and because I wanted to dedicate one set for home, and one for work.If forced to name a con, I would have only the weight to consider.  Sure, they're heavier than the AE2s, but they have components necessary to making the function cordlessly.  It's to be expected.I do think the price is pretty fair for phones of this quality.  (I didn't buy them on Amazon, but I did want to review them)UPDATE: 02/13/2019It's been about a year and 3 months.  These headphones are still working like the first day.  There is some minor wear on the ear pads, and I can see I'll have to replace them this year maybe, perhaps around November when they will be two-years old.I'd by them again, no doubt.  I use these headphones even more than my first pair of Bose.  I use them approximately 7-8 hours per day, 5 days per week.  I haven't noticed any waning of battery life.The wear that I mention is normal.  I saw one negative reviewer complain about it (after 1.4 years???)  What does this person expect?  Oils from our skin will wear down the ear pads, or humidity in the air might also do it.  This is normal, and comes with the territory.Comfort:  This is mostly subjective.  I can say (objectively) that the ear pads are soft and remain so after over a year of use.  What else is there?  The shape of one's ears will dictate how they perceive the comfort level.  You just have to try them on.  For me, I get use-fatigue after about 7-8 hours of essentially continual use.I can't imagine a pair of Bluetooth headphones working better for me.  Still 5 stars.

            ","I had been wanting a good pair of bluetooth headphones and I received the Beats Studio headphones as a gift.  I was excited and giddy until I actually tried them out.  They fit great and were super comfortable, but the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) that it used drove me nuts. It introduced a low hissing sound to try to cancel out the noise around you. When listening to music, you don't really notice it, but when watching YouTube videos or a movie, the hissing is very apparent in the quiet parts.  I couldn't deal with that.  I took them back to Target and I was going to get the Beats Solo 3 headphones until I saw that these Bose SoundLink headphones were on sale, making them slightly cheaper than the Beats Solo 3 headhpones.  I tried them on and they felt great on my ears and the sound quality was great.  I was so impressed that I went with the SoundLink headphones.If you are looking for headphones so clear, so vibrant, so jaw-droppingly awesome that you think you will hear Angels singing in glory, well, these aren't it, but they are pretty close.  The sound quality is excellent and the bass is punchy, but doesn't hit as hard as it would in some others (like Beats) but I'm ok with that.  I was a little bummed that there was no visual battery level indicator on these like the one on the Beats Solo 3, but I found out that when you first turn the headphones on, you will hear a robotic voice that says ""battery level is 90%"" or something like that, so that makes up for it to me. To be fair, there is a battery light indicator, but it just works differently.  The light just changes from green to amber to red as the power decreases.I've really enjoyed using these so far.  I haven't used them long enough to verify that they actually last 15 hours before needing to be recharged, but I've used them for several hours now and the battery is still indicating green and it hasn't dropped below 85%. One thing to note is the included accessories (audio cable and micro USB charging cable) are hidden away in an enclosed pocket inside of the case.  It would be nice if the documentation told you that because I was expecting it to be inside the box and I thought I was missing these until I noticed a lumpy area inside the headphone case. Anyway, great headphones!

So, along comes Amazon prime days. At a $70 discount I had to make this purchase. Life is good again!  These headphones paired immediately and easily with my phone. They  shipped with a  probably 75 % charge. I simply didn't want to take them off. Lightweight and comfortable, they block external noise well.  The case that was included is perfect, they fit, with a nice little pocket for the charging cord as well as a much appreciated cord for use with a headphone jack.

            ","At $229 I cannot recommend these enough. Let me tell you why.I was getting ready for a trip to Texas and I was also planning on listening to a lot of music during that trip. The last time I flew on an airplane, I had a tiny pair of earbuds that sounded decent, but since that time I had become a bit more of a particular level of quality to my sound (let's just say I had splurged on an Audioquest DAC). Plus, they were broken. I wanted something that felt portable, though.I decided one thing right away: the next set of headphones I buy, and I might end up splurging a bit on them, didn't have to be earbuds. In fact, I didn't really want them to be earbuds. Most earbuds I've used tend to feel a little uncomfortable in my ears after more than a couple hours, and I always felt like their cord got tangled up super easily, and ...And maybe the cord thing got me started. I had recently got a new phone, too (Google Pixel) and I had the idea of wireless headphones suddenly swimming around in my head. I decided to march into the nearest Target or BestBuy, and since I had put this off until just a couple days before my flight, bite the bullet on paying the ""manufacturer's suggested retail price"". I decided to go for something pretty reasonable in price, hoping it would exceed my expectations. I purchased a pair of Skullcandy Uproars for about $50.And boy, did they suck.Sure, they were comfortable enough (being so light) and had an appealing look. After tearing the box open at my car, they paired easily with my phone, I found the manual controls easy to feel out. I put on a track I had just been listening to on the car stereo, something by The Menzingers.Let me tell you something. My car stereo is not good. Not good at all. These Skullcandy Uproars sounded like absolute shit. Intolerable. I had to return the damn things after a couple of hours because they sounded unbelieveably bad. Supremely disappointing.Round two — the Sony MDRXB650BT. (And what a fun name. What a joy to have to Google their name, despite the fact that I bought this product only two weeks ago and used it for a whole day.) (Spoiler: I returned these, too.)The Sony's were twice as much as the Skullcandy, about $100. The quality increase was immediately noticeable. These sounded good. Really good. Really nice level of bass, bright and precise treble, plenty of clarity throughout. I'm not an audiophile, so sorry if that's a crappy description.Only problem was these dang things hurt my ears. I liked the sound of them and walking around the house with them so much that I wore them for about three hours. And my ears started hurting, a lot. Jello ear? Yeah. Just sore. I tried giving my ears breaks and little massages, but it didn't really help. In the morning, I wore them for a half hour and my ears already hurt. I guess I broke their tolerance...Enter Bose. Sorry it took this long to get here. When I returned the Sonys, I was already sold on the idea of wireless 'phones, and I was willing to burn through a little more money if it meant a kickass pair of headphones.These are those headphones.They're comfortable as all hell, even more comfortable than the excellent and trusty Sony MDRV6 studios. The cushions that surround (not sit on!) your ears is soft as hell, almost like touching air. The inner ear cups (?) have a nice fabric lining and a unique angled space inside that fits my ears fantastically. A bit of memory foam on the band also keeps the top of my head from feeling like something is resting on it. And the whole thing is really, really light. I seriously forget I'm wearing these things.They don't fold up, but each 'cup' (I don't know what to call them!) does swivel quite a bit. In fact, when I opened the package, I was surprised to find that they were actually already settled into the included case (I didn't realize it came with a case; great touch). Putting them in and out of the case (if I actually take them off or don't leave them around my neck) is effortless, slips easy into my backpack, and provides a nice piece of mind that they are protected.Pairing is great. Easy. Fast. You can pair more than one thing and swap through each device by toggling the side switch. Very occasionally I can't get the right device for a few moments, but I've heard they can also interrupt each other — for instance, a phone call might be able to interrupt a stream from your laptop. (I haven't noticed this yet, but I don't get a lot of calls.)The wireless strength is excellent under most conditions I found myself in. At home, lounging around, as well as walking around with the phone in my pocket or my hand, I must say I haven't noticed a single hiccup. It's terrific. The range is quite good, too. I can walk around a whole bunch of my house when using my laptop or phone. Where did it not fare so well? Bicycling in Corpus Christi Texas led to some hiccupping, a little reminiscent of CDs skipping at times. I DO RECOMMEND UPDATING THE FIRMWARE IF YOU ARE HAVING ANY STUTTERING ISSUES. That seemed to help. I can't say for sure if it was the VERY jangly motion of my phone in my pocket, or if being on a city on the coast and all of the signals surrounding me had an effect, too. In any case, sitting here at home, it's flawless.And did I mention they sound great? I mean, I have nothing to complain about at all. The bass is lovely. Not loud bass, but precise bass. And a bit ethereal. It could be louder but I think it's great. Treble sounds amazing on these. Good lord, amazing. Midrange, especially, vocals, also sound brilliant. These are a significant step above those Sony 650's (and also sounded WAY better than the comparably-priced but bass-overloaded Sony MDRXB950BTs I tested in the store).The battery life is excellent. A little voice tells you the percentage every time you turn the thing on. ""Battery, 90%."" ""Battery, 60%."" I've rarely heard it go below that, because the battery life is awesome. Much like your phone, if you stick it on the charger at night, you'll be just about certain to get through a whole day. Unlike your phone, if you're only using them for a couple hours each day, you can easily go a few days without charging. That's nice.The controls on the side are well-placed and intuitive. You can do volume up/down, pause, and skip forward/back. Perfect.Finally, having wireless headphones that sound good is just... pretty sweet. I don't need to worry about the placement of my cord and how it might awkwardly knock my phone off a side table if pulled the wrong way. I don't need to worry about busting the headphone jack by keeping it in my pocket. I don't need to wrap an excessively long cord around my phone next time I go biking. I can actually walk short distances away from whatever device I'm using without carrying it with me. Basically, there start to be a lot less reasons as to why you would take them off so frequently.And again, as I mentioned, they're comfortable as hell and they sound wonderful.So I've been using them a lot. Many, many hours. Almost nonstop, I daresay. I've been using them for walking around the house and doing stuff, instead of feeling tied down to my speaker system and desktop computer. Mowing the lawn. Typing at my desk without a cord laying over or around my keyboard. My phone slides in and out of my pocket way more gracefully. I don't have to worry about yanking my phone off the dresser at night. You start to notice the little things.Basically, if you can afford these — if you're even thinking about wireless headphones above $100 — GET THESE.Next step: can I get these to work with my record player somehow?

            ","Overall (tl;dr)Form: Bose SLIIFunction: Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBTI've had a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M35s for about 5 years now, and after seeing both Bose SLII and Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT go on sale, I thought I'd try them out. My main complaints with the M35s were poor quality earpads and a jack that I slightly bent, which I could not remedy with a new 3.5mm cord (the cord was fixed - M40x and above have jack plugs on the headphones). I replaced the earpads on the M35s with a large aftermarket pair when the original pads started falling apart after 2 years, and they were much better.Comfort: Bose SLIILooking at both pairs of headphones, you can tell that one was designed as portable from the ground up and the other is a studio monitor set with bluetooth. The Bose are lighter and clamp on your head much less, and the pads easily fit my big ears inside with room to spare. It appears Audio-Technica hasn't updated their pads since I got my M35s: the pads feel more like on-ear not over-ear headphones, and don't think they'll last forever. That being said, I tried the aftermarket pads I have on the M50xBTs and that fixed it. They are still larger and heavier, and clamp more, than the SLIIs.Isolation/Noise Cancellation: Bose SLIIWhile the M50xBTs aren't bad, the SLIIs do a better job of keeping outside noise out. Aftermarket pads on the M50xBTs evened things out, though.Wired Sound Quality: M50xBTsWhile I don't claim to be a professional audiologist and I didn't exactly test these rigorously, I can tell that there is a bit more definition and clarity in the M50xBTs. They also bring the lower end/bass out a little more. That being said, the SLIIs are still of good quality. Just know that the jack on the SLIIs is smaller than the standard 3.5mm (2.7mm I think). The SLIIs come with a plain 3ft 3.5 male to 2.7mm male cable (which plug into an audio source and the headphones respectively). The M50xBTs come with a 3ft 3.5mm straight to 90 degree cable with a pause button/microphone unit.Wireless Sound Quality, Wireless vs. Wired: M50xBTThis is where the M50xBTs really shine. I couldn't tell any major difference wired/wireless modes. The SLIIs, however... while they're on sale, sure, but I wouldn't call the wireless audio quality worth the MSRP of $230. There is an obvious difference between wired and wireless use on the SLIIs, most notably bass being EQ'd much lower while wireless (I'd guess it makes the battery last longer). Don't get me wrong, the quality is still much better than you'd get out of any earbuds, but the M50xBTs definitely take the cake here.Wireless/Bluetooth General: ?Both have volume control on the headphones, and some Smart Assistant/phone call functionality (I don't and won't be using either of those so I've not tested them, I'm sure they work fine and similar to each other). I've not tested the validity of these claims, but manufacturers promise 15hrs on the SLII and 40hrs on the M50xBTs (they can fit a larger battery because they are larger, they'll take longer to fully charge but both should have similar charge time to use time ratios), so roughly 2 days of extended use of the SLII and about a week on the M50xBTs. Those are rough estimates, but the point is that if you forget to plug them in the night after a day of long use, they should still be good for another day's use. They both use micro-USB charging ports and both come with USB to micro-USB cables.Construction: ?Most components on both headphones are made out of high-quality plastic/polymer. At this price range I'd prefer some metal components, especially around the hinges connecting the earpieces to the headband. I'd bet that the M50xBTs will take longer to break due to thicker and heavier construction, but that's not to say the SLIIs will fall apart after a day. The cloth and leather wrapped around the headband feels nice on both pairs, while the earpads will probably deteriorate quicker because more wear happens around that area. I strongly recommend getting aftermarket pads sooner rather than later - they are much more comfortable and have lasted much longer than the originals.Other StuffThe M50xBTs come with a nice leather drawstring pouch and the SLIIs come with a small carrying case. I'd trust the case more when putting it in a bag full of stuff, but don't expect it to pass a 6ft drop test with flying colors.

They are very light weight and I sometimes forget i have them on. They connected to my phone right away without any issues. I love that they have an on/off switch and she tells you your battery percentage. The battery life and range are amazing. Way better than the battery and range on the beats. I can go about a week without charging them and I use them daily for about 4 hours. The sound quality is by far the best. Very crisp, its not just base like the beats. The noise cancelation is also an added plus. When I have the headphones on at the gym or outside I cant hear anything but my tunes! I am super super satisfied with these and so glad my husband got them! I don't plan on going back to beats!

            ","In the world of audio, $270 can get you pretty far. There are plenty of budget audiophile grade headphones, amps, dacs, portable players etc that can be acquired for under $270. There is this sweet spot where after a certain price point however, the return on your money spent begins to diminish, and you quickly get into the thousands of dollars to see smaller and smaller improvements.These Bluetooth headphones, whether wired into a source or wireless falls pretty flat and does't really reach that price/performance sweet spot unfortunately. The wireless performance is hampered by weak volume, which means that you'll be cranking these phones up to near max get a good loudness. This is especially true if you're traveling or outside with background noise. It also suffers from inherent flaws with bluetooth, which is compressed sound that will never be as good as wiring the headphone into our computer or phone. The headphone is also a bit more leaky than some other closed back headphones i've use, with sound pouring out for others to hear. It has decent passive noise cancellation, but I don't believe it's any better or worse than most headphones on the market in that respect. To me, that hampers the mobility of these headphones. There are simply more powerful wireless solutions in the market, ones that include APTX (better bluetooth performance) and a beefier amplifier in the headphone.The wired performance will be noticeable better as long as the source you're connecting is better than the bluetooth components in the headphone (most likely yes). The headphone will have more volume and a bit more thickness to the sound itself. Unfortunately these are rather poor wired headphones. It suffers from anemic bass, and with such a weak low end response, as the volume goes up the more brash the sound becomes causing me to wince and have to turn down the volume. Bose clearly has their sound sculpted for a certain listeners, and it unfortunately disagrees with my ears. One thing I did note is a gradual improvement in sound as I used the headphone more.(Note: I listened to these wired and wirelessly on a Macbook Pro with Tidal HIFI streaming, and compared them with the Sennheiser Momentums V1. The 2nd Generation model goes for $250, though it's wired. They have a wireless version with noise cancellation for a whopping $499)On the plus side:These headphones are incredibly comfortable, with a plushy soft leather padding for the earcup (thought a tad more shallow than i'd like for my large ears). It's got plastic but it's a well built headphone and the plastic serves to make it incredibly light. The built in HD Microphone is quite convenient, and all the hardware buttons on the headphone itself are easy to press and pretty easy to figure out. It has NFC pairing, and the process of pairing and connecting is plenty easy and convenient. The headphone does a great job with dialogue and it's great to connect to an Amazon Fire TV and get good clean sound from your shows and not disturb anyone around you.These headphones are going back though. The convenience of wireless doesn't override the disappointing sound. I'm not even convinced that bluetooth over the ear headphones really even make sense at this point, when there are plenty of excellent wireless earbuds that are much more portable and isolate more sound (including Bose's own QuietComfort earbuds).I think most people should lower their expectations of wireless headphones as well as the Bose brand and reputation. Buy these if comfort and features matter most, but if you truly expect better price to performance with audio quality, these wont meet them are there are hundreds of other options out there for the same price or better.

After these went on sale on Amazon for 229.99, I couldn't resist and decided to buy a pair. Having them for a span of a few days, I can say that these are just absolutely awesome. Though I am not an expert at audio, everything sounds very clear and nice. One of the main things that I love about these headphones is the fact that you can pair two devices at once. For example, if you are watching a movie or listening to music on your tablet, and your phone starts ringing, the headphones will automatically switch from the tablet to the phone and you can answer your call. This is great for someone who has multiple devices and don't want to waste time pairing everything single time. Another thing that I love about these headphones is that it includes a case for protection when traveling. If you are thinking that these headphones are a little more expensive, consider that these include a very nice case that might otherwise cause you to spend 10 or more dollars for ones that might not even fit your headphones correctly. Overall, I can recommend this case. Being someone who doesn't travel much and mostly likes to use my headphones indoors, I felt no reason as to why I should by the noise canceling Bose QC35s. These suit my needs perfectly and I can definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some high quality wireless headphones.

"1804",4,"November 13, 2016","Color: Black",FALSE,"Poor noise isolation, good comfort with some caveats.
            ","First off, I have to mention the good points, of which there are several.  The headset is lightweight with a premium feel (wouldn't expect anything else from Bose...).  It just feels so well-built in your hand and on your head.  The whole experience is seamless.  When you plug in the cable, the headset shuts off and goes into wired mode; when you unplug the cable, BT turns on and immediately connects to your devices.  Speaking of which, you can connect to two devices simultaneously.  The headset intelligently switches between your devices depending on which is playing sound.  The controls are well-placed and easy to use.As for comfort, it could go either way.  The earcups are super soft and the drivers are angled.  However, the cups are not as deep as the QC35.  The QC35 is a newer design and has two differences compared to the SoundLink: the cups are deeper, and the hinge wells are much smaller/non-existent.  This means that if you have larger ears, or ears that stick out a bit, you may have discomfort on the SoundLink that you wouldn't have on the QC35.  My (adult male) ears aren't even that big, and both the drivers and the hinge wells on the SoundLink touched/pressed on my ears, causing instant discomfort.  I have no such issues with the QC35.As for sound quality, it's solid.  I'm not an audiophile, but it produced a very balanced and clear sound not lacking in any particular area.  The problem is the very poor noise isolation.  It means you either have to crank the volume or listen in a silent room to get the most out of the headphones.  For my uses, I didn't care, though I was put-off considering the price point.  If you're a frequent traveler it definitely could be an issue.I really wanted to like this headset.  In fact, I waited until the last minute to return it.  Ultimately I decided it didn't have enough redeeming points to justify the price and my ears hurting.  I went with the QC35 and must say it's worth every penny.  It's one of the finest pieces of technology I've ever owned.

            ","As someone who is always after the best sound for my money, here goes the review of my Bose Bluetooth headphones.Now, audiophiles always criticize companies beats and Bose for being too mainstream and too ""Over-Pricey"". However, These headphones are by no means over-priced (considering the fact that the headset is Bluetooth). The other headphones I own that I have to compare with this are the following: Bowers & Wilkins C5 S2 (earbuds), Audio Technica MSR7, Audio Technica AtH-M50, And Platronics BackBeatPros (which were the previous set of bluetooth headphones that I gave away as a gift.)Now, Let's start off with the sound: The sound is crisp and clear with the highs being rolled down just a tiny bit (At least coming from the MSR7 which is an audiophile grade headphone that's strong suit is the highs). However, I could say why the Highs are rolled off because these headphones are intended to be comfortable and headphones with strong highs can sound fatiguing at higher volumes. Now, to the mid-range. The mid range is great on these and Piano sounds absolutely delightful on those. If you like listening to a lot of songs with piano in there, you will LOVE those. The bass is present, not too overpowering (makes these good for Pop music). The Active EQ in these headphones boosts the soundstage significantly. I was pleasantly surprised with the sound-stage on these i found them to be great (Possibly on par with the MSR7's in that area). The sound signature is quite smooth and pleasant. I personally was very happy about having a more fun pair of headphones like these (As opposed to the VERY critical MSR7's which let you hear every single mistake in the recording). The Plugged Mode is my favorite feature of these as the sound does go louder (volume explained briefly below) with the cable in which was a great surprise for me because the Platronics sounded horrible with the cable in. With the cable in those sounds like COMPLETELY different headphones. Not sure if the ACTIVE EQ is still active when in passive mode, but the highs open up better, and the sound was truly satisfactory and (it's really great that you can have headphones that have two different sound signatures just by plugging in a cord. Add bluetooth and you have a winner!). If you would like to compare these with the Platronics Backbeat Pro: I like the sound of these much better (With the except of hard rock, and rock music where that sounds amazing on the platronics) otherwise the platronics Have A S*** TON Of cool features. However, I do like these more in the end based on the sound. Also, those look great in my opinion (and CERTAINLY much better looking than the Platronics Back Beat Pro's)Cons: The biggest con of these headphones is the volume. If you're a commuter and are in high volume environment these may not be able to over power that sound (however, the isolation is quite good). The reason I did not take off a star for this con is the WIRED MODE!! (ITS GREAT)

Since I mostly listen to podcasts, it was not the sound quality but none of the other brands did a decent job while answering calls.  This was a deal breaker for me.  I did not want to sound unprofessional or unclear answering business calls.I had looked at the earlier version of these and did not like the dongle thing hanging on to the side.  Then I saw the new version where the microphone is built into speakers.  I couldn't decide between the on ear version or the around ear version.  The around ear version version sounded a slight bit better - probably because the speakers are somewhat larger than the on ear version.  So I went with the around ear version.This is the only bluetooth that I can use to answer phone calls without sounding like I am talking from the bottom of a well.The fit is so comfortable that I forget I am wearing them.  The only thing I would change is to make the fit a slight bit tighter.  Other than that I hope to use these till they fall apart.I like the fact that these can be connected to two devices at the same time.  And switching seems almost automatic.  When a call comes, it switches to the phone and back to what you were doing after the call ends.  Nice touch.One more thing.  When I first got them I thought I heard my phone skip a little.  I remembered a reviewer or two talking about upgrading the firmware.  I went to the Bose website, downloaded the Bose Updater, plugged it my phone and ugraded the firmware,  No issues at all since then.

I'm switching it occasionally between 3 devices: my Thinkpad T440 laptop (Win-10), Galaxy Tab S tablet, and Galaxy S4 phone.  But everytime I try to make the switch, I literally feel like pulling my hair out! This is a typical scenario - this morning, I wanted to pair it to my laptop. I would go to my phone and tablet, and turn Bluetooth off; and turn Bluetooth on in my laptop. When I turn the headphone on, the headphone goes through the entire list of previously connected devices (there's a female voice talking to you).  My laptop clearly says it's connected to the headphone, yet the Soundlink's female voice just continues to say ""finding bluetooth devices; finding ""Thinkpad T440"""" in a non-ending loop! And when I play music on my laptop, music doesn't come through. This is the same situation with my phone, tablet, and Asus C100 Chromebook (though I rarely connect it to the Asus); where the computing device says it's connected to the headphones, but the headphone is just continuously searching for devices. The only way to alleviate it is turning the headphones on and off indefinately until it decides to receive signal from the computing device.  Sometimes it'd work after turning on/off 3x, sometimes 12x. So this morning, it literally took me 5 minutes (which seems like eternity) to force the headphones to connect to the laptop.  I know none of my neighbors have the same ""Soundlink"" headphone because before having the headphones, I never saw ""Soundlink AE2"" in the list of pairable Bluetooth device list.  For reference, I was previously using 2 different bluetooth headsets in the past (""Sol Republic Air Tracks"" and ""JBL Everest 100""); and have NEVER had a problem with those headphones when I switched pairing-devices.For a device that costs 3x as much as my older wireless headsets, I expect the Bluetooth module to be better than my old headsets. The Bose definately sounds better than the other 2 wireless headphones I have, but I still think my wired Sol Republic Master Tracks sound better (the Sol's sound seem to have a ""rounder"" feel to them).  I gave it atleast 3-stars despite the buggy Bluetooth module because they're definately the best-sounding wireless headphones I've tested out that are priced in the ~$200 range.

They weren't noise-cancelling, but still about $125. (Why Apple didn't pony up a few more billion and buy Bose instead of Beats is beyond a mystery to me.. Quality and strength of brand, plus track record and patent portfolio that Beats is a joke compared to.) Bose really screwed up on these - especially the terrible warranty and customer service I received when the vinyl-like material on the earphones began to peel after a little over a year.

I actually prefer them to the more expensive QC35s I have (bluetooth with noise cancelling) because they are lighter on your head and don't have that weird 'vacuum' effect that noise cancelling headphones have. Of course the QC35s are way, way better on a plane flight.They are not without faults though.  Even running the latest firmware available as at Jan 2017, they have problems with audio quality when  connected to two Bluetooth sources at once. For example, if I am on a phone call with my iPhone 7 but the headphones are also connected to my MacBook Pro, the call will often become 'robotic sounding' to the point where the audio is unintelligible and the call has to be terminated and redialled. The other way of fixing this is to disconnect them from the Bluetooth menu on the MacBook Pro, but it is annoying to be fiddling doing this while on a phone call.The other issue is the microphone in wind -- contrary to Bose's claim that it is designed to perform well in wind, it absolutely doesn't. The mic is on the front side of the headphones and so it totally collects any oncoming wind and causes loud interference on the call. When I'm outside I frequently find myself cupping my hand around the microphone to protect it from the wind.Neither are a dealbreaker; it's still the best Bluetooth headphone I've tried, and Bose's voice synthesis for selecting which Bluetooth source to connect to is an absolute godsend compared to the beeps and boops and 'try your luck' I've had with other BT headphones. I literally cannot stress enough how great this feature is.If Bose could correct the above two defects I'd be very happy indeed. I hold out hope that the glitchy audio quality while two BT sources are connected can be fixed with a firmware update, though it may well be that this is a silicon-level limitation of the vendor Bose has sourced its Bluetooth chips from.

I tried them for a week and wasn't impressed with the connection ability. I decided to return them since it was still a relatively new line of product and needed to be improved. Well three years later I decided to have a look again and was impressed by the new sleek design. I went to Bose during a sale and bought a pair. Bose has done an excellent job at improving these headsets. The connection has no problems at all. I can be connected to multiple devices at the same time. I can be listening to music on my computer and be able to answer my phone if someone calls.The battery life is excellent and can go for days without charging. They are very comfortable to wear as are most Bose headsets. Yes they are a bit expensive, but I believe they are worth every penny.

Moreover I really like that, since they are bluetooth and just need to be charged, they can reside by your bed or chair so you don't have to get up to get them, which is sometimes the case with the type that are plugged in directly to a TV headphone jack.

The bass isn't as ""booming"" with these headphones compared to my Beats. However, those who say you can't listen to hip-hop in these headphones are plain wrong - the bass is still dope. On the other hand, the highs are really something else - they have enabled me to hear new things in some of my favorite songs. In terms of other genres, Bose's EQ is spot on.In terms of connectivity, I really like the ability to connect to two things at once.

"1826",5,"August 30, 2015","Color: Black",FALSE,"Outstanding Bluetooth For Music And Phone Calls
            ","For purposes of full disclosure please note I received these headphones in exchange for an honest review, and I do mean honest review. As an audio-nut I own lots of headphones including several sets of wired, conventional wireless, and Bluetooth headphones and I’ll say right up front that I’m surprised just how much I like these headphones. As a pretty hardcore audio-nut I’ve been disappointed by every set of Bluetooth headphones up to this point, including some with some pretty good ratings, and as a typical audio-nut I’m usually skeptical of anything labeled Bose.  However, these Bose SoundLink II headphones came as a very pleasant surprise. I spent several hours listening to a mix of music that included vocals, bass leads, intricate guitar, and a new age album that reliably trips up poor speakers and headphones alike – a test that every other Bluetooth headphone in my collection had failed miserably. But let’s start with the design.The SoundLink II headphones are conventional looking closed back headphones with all of the controls and a flush fitting microphone for use with a phone on the right side. For those new to headphones, closed headphones provide excellent isolation and privacy at the expense of sound quality. Generally speaking open headphones sound better, but at the cost of you hearing everything around you and everyone in the room hearing very clearly what you are listening to. The Soundlink II also functions as a Bluetooth headset for phone calls, and reports from friends are that the microphone sounds outstanding (better than any of my Plantronics headsets) in phone calls, however I did not test the microphone’s noise cancelling ability. Comfort was quite good even for my large head.I began my listening test with Diana Krall’s The Girl In The Other Room and was pleased to note that these Bose headphones captured the sultry smokiness of her vocals perfectly. Next I moved on to Chris Rea’s Hofner Blue Notes. In this rare jazz album an electric bass takes the role of the lead instrument and is accompanied by beautiful piano and drum work. Frankly I was afraid that the bass might be more than a set of Bluetooth headphones could reproduce cleanly, but I need not have worried because the Bose did a marvelous job of digging deep and reproducing those deep soulful bass riffs for a closed back headphone - when played at reasonable volumes. Crank up the volume too high and the bass starts getting muddy but that’s understandable. As a reality check I listened to of bass master Marcus Miller’s Nikki’s Groove and found the same to be the case, keep the volume reasonable on the bass heavy tunes. At normal safe listening levels they do a credible job for a closed headphone. Finally I spent some quality time with Manheim Steamroller’s Fresh Aire III. Whether or not this album is your cup of tea its deep powerful bass and airy mids and detailed highs do a great job of tripping up poor speakers. The SoundLink II passed the Fresh Air III test with flying colors.In conclusion, don’t expect these (or any other closed-back headphones) to compete with top of the line wired open-back headphones, but the SoundLinks are head and shoulders the best (and most expensive) Bluetooth headphones that I’ve listened to and I wouldn’t hesitate to buy a set if I were in the market.

However for this price I'd expect better sound quality. In the handset (HSP/HFP) mode sound is so bad the headset is practically unusable. In the headphone (A2DP) mode sound is better, but still not great. High frequencies seem to be cut off, which could be a result of using an older Bluetooth version. In both modes (HSP/HFP and A2DP) there's hiss whenever Bluetooth circuitry wakes up. When music is loud it is not noticeable, but when music is quiet or you are listening to speech you can clearly hear the hiss. If you use this with a laptop, the headset will hiss at you from time to time even when you are not listening to anything, e.g. when you switch to a browser tab that contains paused audio/video.These seem to be systemic problems with this model, not problems with one particular headset.

I find myself charging them weekly or biweekly• Crisp highs, clean mids, and distinct lows. The lows do not lack whatsoever, as the bass can be considerable.• Decent external sound muffling; it probably doesn't compare to sound canceling, but it's nice• Bluetooth range of about 20ft from source (if it's not obvious, the connection exponentially decreases/break up if separated by dense objects.. like a brick wall)• Construction: a durable polymer that neither appears cheap nor blemishes easily• Practical button placement & controlsJust one con:• The mic - no hand-free experience here folks; without (any?) beamforming or acoustic filtering, it's worse than talking on speaker phone, honest.

Unless you are a very, and I mean VERY, particular listener, you will not notice too much of a difference. These sound nearly identical to my Beats Solo 2 wireless headphones. The benefit that Bose has over Beats is comfort. That is not to say that the Beats are not comfortable, they just have a tendency to place pressure on both sides of the head. The over the ear cup on the Bose SoundLink II's are far more comfortable than the Beats on ear style. However, the Beats definitely have more of a glamorous look and, if that is important to you, you should definitely not pick the Bose. If comfort is more important than a less clunky look, you should definitely go with these.Oh, P.S. BOO on Bose for not including a wall charger with the SoundLink II's!

            ","Excellent!  Very comfortable and sound great.  Pairs easily.  I use them with my iPod touch 5th gen mostly for listening to hemi sync but I also listen to a lot of 70's lite rock and classic rock.  These headphones accurately reproduce sound as was intended when recorded.  Plenty of bass where bass was intended as well as highs and midrange.  Not as loud as the ear buds that came with ipod but much more comfortable.  In my opinion the control buttons are very easy to access and distinguish which buttons do what.  I'm a little concerned that the on/off/pair switch operates a bit hard.  Takes a bit of pressure to turn on and off although when sliding switch to the third position to pair is quite effortless...I hope this isn't going to present a problem in the future, ie switch completely breaking.

If connected to Bose Stereo, they maintain their clear, crisp sound that I would expect from these headphones, but the microphone was disabled and I was unable to make calls using Skype and Hangouts.

            ","I picked these up from a local best buy convinced I would be as happy with them as my QC25 set that I already had. And I have to say they're noticeably less comfortable and made of lower quality materials. I'll start off with a couple bugs, problems, and defects I had in my pair.The cloth inside the ear cups was never glued down around the back. I would return or exchange already just for that.When I'm on a phone call, the headphones start making a clicking noise that changes in volume, but never goes away until I hang up and call again. Sometimes it's loud enough to hurt my ears if I have the volume turned up. At this point I'm most definitely returning or exchanging.Now this gripe may have more to do with my phone than the headset, but it's still a problem for me. The audio skips quite obviously any time my phone is computing a process. As I type this review with only amazon and a music player open, I've heard probably 20 to 30 skips. This is really annoying and absolutely interferes with my enjoyment of my music.Now a gripe that actually isn't a quality check problem. They're too tight on my head. I have an average sized head and after 5 to 7 hours I'm forced to use ear buds or else develop a headache just from the pressure on either side of my head.When I turn on the headphones, I get the pleasure of listening to ""connecting to 'device name'"" I think 3 times unless I have my phone or laptop immediately ready to pair. And I can only hear the battery level if I power off the headphones, then turn them back on.Now if the glitches and defects weren't there, the headphones are pretty decent.The clarity of sound is what you would expect from bose. Very nice and clean sound with crisp, but not harsh highs, perfectly balanced with the mids. However, it's very lacking in bass until the volume is at about 90% and since I normally listen to my music at about 50% volume, that's definitely an issue for me. The battery life is sufficient, but not impressive. I use my headphones a lot and usually, if I listen to my music at 50% to 75% volume for about 10 hours and spend a couple hours on the phone, the battery is too low to make it through another day, so I  have to remember to charge them every night or else go without them for a couple hours at some random time of day. Any normal user should expect to go a few days without having to charge these, but personally, I would like to see at least 20 hours of play time.When in a phone call, you'll hear what the microphone is picking up as well as the person on the other end. I like that I can tell if I'm putting someone through hell with wind noise or background chatter, but I do miss how the QC25's completely obliterate background noise when I'm listening to someone on the phone.The microphone is decent, but only just. I expected better from bose, but then again, the in line mic on the QC25's fell short here too.All in all, if bugs weren't there, I would be happy paying about $175 for these. I'll probably end up returning these because of the defects, and try to find another pair of bluetooth headphones for travel.

I wear a baseball cap when walking, and they fit right over it, no problem. The headphones stay in place, and don't slide around or get annoying.The sound quality is light-years ahead of the sound quality of the standard earbuds.The cushioning does not get sweaty and uncomfortable against your skin on warm days. Sweat is not absorbed by the cushioning, so you are not left with yukky soggy earphones at the end of your walk.  I did not test them in extremely hot weather.Cautions:The headphones do not block out sounds around you completely, but they are reduced. Probably not a good idea to wear them someplace where you need to hear the sounds of traffic around you.Unknown:I don't know how well the headphones would block out the sound of a lawnmower or other power tool.I did not attempt to sync this with my laptop, so I don't know how well that works.Cons:This is minor - I wish the carrying case (which is very nice) had a strap or loop to slide over the wrist.I am extremely happy with these headphones!

How dumb is that.We have since unpaired her phone.  So every time she might want to usr the headset for a call, I will have to unpair mine - or make sure I am not going to make any calls - before she can use it.Another problem I have is that even with it just paired to mine, it seems to disconnect without warning.  If I turn on the headset and start to make a call I will hear myself dialing the number, but then when the call connects it will disconnect the Bose headphones.

            ","So let's talk about my personal experiences with headsets so far. For phone and portable devices, I've been using the  Sol Republic (bluetooth) headset and for my gaming PC experience, the Logitech G930 (wireless but not bluetooth). At home, for music I primarily listen to either my 5.1 PC or Home Theater set-up. I am appreciate music, but I am not going to be your best source for someone who is truly refined in their audio tastes.Now the case for this headphone is pretty interesting. It might seem a little unusual to start with the case, but it's kind of worth noting. To truly test these headphones, I took them across the country on airplanes. The case came with me on the carry-on. Now for those of you who remember carrying around CD cases, this is a little larger than those, with a nice look and feel to them. There is a pocket on the inside to carry the audio port cable, in case your device does not have bluetooth, and for the USB charger. By the way, the USB charge cord is so short I find it fairly useless. I have a ton of these cords, so I leave the tiny one in the case just in, well, case. Anyway the case does have a little support with an upright firmer piece that also helps you align your headphones in the case. I wouldn't recommend piling anything heavy on the case, but it has support for some light pressure.Now the headphones do turn to flatten in the case for easy portability. This makes it a little smaller than the Sol Republic since the earpieces are smaller as is the headband. Speaking of the headband, that of course adjusts easily but their is actually padding on the band that makes this very comfortable to wear. In fact, comfort is definitely a factor here. Over the ear styles are generally pretty comfortable, but this just feels light and non-intrusive. The Sol, for example is on the ear and applies quite a bit of noticeable pressure when it's on. The G930 is over the ear but it just feels huge and bulky. I was able to easily take a nap or two with the Bose without really feeling it was there unless I bumped the headband against the body of the plane.These were very easy to use. Pairing the devices were a breeze. The system tells you what percentage of the battery is left (90% for example), and told me who was calling when a call came in. I would prefer the number of hours left rather than the percentage (Sol does this), but getting an announcement of who is calling was pretty great. Button use is easy and intuitive with + and - easy to see. There's a small battery and bluetooth indicator by the buttons as well. As far as call quality goes, I only received one complaint and that was a person who probably didn't notice the noise in the background of where she was because no one else ever complained... and I specifically asked them how it was. Music quality is pretty good. I could hear the base, it was a rich sound, but the base is probably better on other devices for sure. If you lower the volume too much, you seem lose the base almost entirely. The G930, of course, has excellent sound and music and important noises in the games at noticeable... and this isn't even close, nor would I expect it to be.My only real complaint for this headphone is it doesn't block out noise at all. This is not noise canceling. Bose is pretty popular at my workplace, and coworkers seemed surprised even reluctant to believe that Bose would produce a product without noise canceling. I assured them I could hear that the flight attendant was talking, a couple in the back would not stop talking, and on one flight we had a pretty unhappy baby. My fear is Bose has such a reputation for having noise canceling headphones that people will see the price tag of this and the brand name and just assume it's there when it's clearly not. The only noise canceling you get from this is from the fact it's around your ear. Now note, the other two headphones Sol and G930, aren't noise canceling either. Active Noise Canceling is not a requirement for me, not yet in anyway.Between the two portable devices, Sol and this Bose, the Bose is the better set. It's also a lot more expensive. To save money, the Sol is good just not as portable or comfortable. For those wanting all the features of what Bose usually offers, you need to wait for Active Noise Canceling. For the rest of us, this Bose might be worth considering. It will certainly my choice for any listening of considerable time.Update: 10/04/15 - I just want to note I've gone on two more airplane based trips. These headphones are holding up great. The battery life is fantastic on these. I've yet to have to recharge the headphones... wish I could say the same about the media devices. Anyway, there's no visual sign of strain on any of the components. I used them for an in-flight movie, and thus finally got around to use the physical cord which was long and worked great.

            ","Update May 2017: I've dropped one star from this review because I have already had to replace the audio cable twice on this headset  and now there appears to be an issue with the contacts in the can. I have to press the jack in in order to hear well. The headset itself is still marvelous but, at this price point, I would expect the cable to be sturdy and to last beyond a few months every time.Original Review : The Bose SoundLink Around Ear 2 headset is an excellent lightweight, comfortable and easy to set up device. Syncing it to any Bluetooth device is very simple and for those without Bluetooth, it ships with an audio cable as well. Once synced to a device, the headphones resync automatically once you are in range of your device. The headset also has the ability to sync to two devices at once so that you can switch between, say, your tablet and phone.Bose has never been about the bling factor and these head have a stylish and yet understated design that has been designed with comfort and ease of use in mind. The inner earcups have large lettering that clearly indicate which ear is Left and which is Right. The leather earpads  and headband are padded and yet the earpads manage to block out a significant amount of external noise. The headband is adjustable and folds up for easy packing.You can control volume on the right earcup and a button on the ear cup controls playback and phonecalls. Normally these are on the cord of corded headphones and so may take some getting used to. Even when using the audio cable, there are no controls on the cable itself. Without the cable, answering phonecalls take a tap of the earpad and the dual microphones make for very good clarity of sound for the person on the other end. However, I definitely found that the sound quality of music when listening on the headphones was better when using Bluetooth as opposed to using the audio cable.The headphones come with a USB charging cable and you get around two hours of battery power from a 15 minute charge. A full charge requires around two hours and should give you around 15 hours of use. The headphones do go into hibernation when not used for 20 minutes when paired and 5 minutes when not paired. This is a terrific feature especially since turning off headphones is something I easily forget to do.I really dislike the new trend of bass boosting in headsets and was relieved to find that the Bose does not do that. While the bass levels are powerful, they do not overwhelm the music.Does all of this mean that the price tag of this headset is justified? I think so since I have yet to be disappointed with the lasting power of a Bose device. This set has been used for hours every day for the past month and it still looks and sounds like it did when first unpacked. If the quality of sound and structure stay the same (and they usually have with other Bose devices that I own) then this is an investment that makes listening to music, conversing on the phone or gaming a more comfortable experience.

The Bluetooth, rechargeble, strong battery life and the louder sound with the cable plugged in made me choose this over the QC25.  The sound quality is excellent and you can get it to play louder with the cable albeit with a slight difference in sound since it loses the EQ settings when not powered.Bose staff said the QC25 had better drivers but I could not pick this when I was testing the two pairs with the same song, same source.  I thought this model sounded better.  Bit more fuller with slightly more bass.I still would like to have the QC25s cause of the noise cancellation and I m sure Bose will have a better headphone if it brings the Bluetooth, rechargeable features for the next QCs.  Maybe they can just add a little bass or even allow the user to adjust the EQ of the headset through an app.Other than that, these are a really an excellent set of headphones that works as advertised.

(The NFC chip is in the right ear of the headphones).  Both were very simple to do, but I found myself relying on the indicator light to know if pairing occurred when using NFC because I was holding the phone and the headphones together to pair in front of me  and could not hear the audio prompts occurring in the headphones (NFC pairs by touching the devices together).Regarding sound quality, I am not an audiophile, so if it sounds good to me, it sounds good.  The sound that comes out of these headphones is super crisp in my opinion.  To me, these seem to be lacking in the bass department, but mids and highs are good.  I  listened to some rock, rap, and movie soundtracks during my initial testing.I like the small size of these and they are comfortable.  A carrying case is included with a wire if Bluetooth and/or NFC/Bluetooth are not options for you.There is one big (at least to me) problem with these that I need to point out.  The sound, at my normal listening level...which may be a bit high, leaks out of these headphones and the people surrounding you can hear what you are listening to. My wife pointed this out to me as I was testing (listening) to various kinds of music.  She could tell me what song I was listening to.  I am usually an earbuds kind of person, and this is not a problem with my earbuds. This may be a problem with headphones of this shape in general and I will have to go back and test other headphones to be sure if other products have this issue.Overall, these are very nice.

This unit has enough space for the ears to tuck neatly inside the cushion ring without that painful smashing. I was also pleased with the sound quality. I was able to hear the subtle bass as well as back up singers that often get faded or muddied in most other methods of listening. The sound quality is far better then those ear buds that embed in your ear canal. I was able to hear the intended richness of the music. The secondary feature of Bose headphones means ambient sound is effectively blocked. I was surprised how quiet the world seemed when wearing the headphones under music use.I also use these for phone calls. There is a microphone in the right side. I had no problem syncing these to my iphone. The person on the other end reports quality sound. My own activities such as making dinner or sweeping the deck transmit to my ears very clearly but are not distracting to the person on the other end. I can wear these and wonder around my apartment doing various activities and experience no connection, no sound and no quality interruptions. These are very comfortable. I have a largish head and do not experience any pinching or discomfort.One thing to note... because of the degree of outside noise blockage...your natural perspiration will be unable to evaporate.

Anyway, I bought these 100% because they are wireless and the fact that based on a lot of professional reviews, the bluetooth connectivity is very stable and reliable. I did not expect them to be the best sounding headphones around ($280 is actually pretty cheap if you're looking in the higher end market). If you want the very best headphones, be prepared to pay a LOT more for a top level wired ones from Sennheiser, Stax, etc. For wireless headphones, the Sennheiser Momentum Wireless are $499. Having said that, I was really surprised by the overall sound from these. The bass is just about right unless you're a real bass head - does not overpower the mids and highs. there has been some criticism of the volume having to be turned up which is true but just turn it up, problem solved. IMHO, if you have to max out the volume completely you either have a hearing problem now or you will soon! Bluetooth functions perfectly and battery life is as described. I bought these to supplement my Shure SE 846 iem's which retail around $1000 but can get uncomfortable for long listening sessions.

Yes, I am also using these with my Macbook Pro (there have been a lot of complaints about crackling when used with OS X, and these complaints are valid but I am going to touch on this in more detail later) as well as an Android phone.Battery Life:I haven't tested if the claim of '15 hours' is accurate, but these headphones have lasted me 2 work days (although I don't listen to them the entire time I at work, I listen to them ~6 hours a day). At the end of the 2nd day I didn't check how much juice was left, but I felt it was a good idea to recharge it so I wouldn't be stranded later.Comfort:Seriously, you will forget you have these on your head. Super comfortable and I haven't had any complaints about noise leakage from coworkers so I can only assume that the noise isolation is doing it's job. Also I have the white color, and I think they are definitely attractive.Sound Quality:If you're looking for top of the line audio fidelity, you probably shouldn't be looking at wireless headphones. The sound quality on these are good enough for my needs, but I know you can probably get better wired headphones for cheaper than $300. I got a sweet deal through employee benefits to get these for about 2/3 the price, so I am content for the quality for the price I am paying (I am looking at it as if I am trading quality for convenience of wireless).Bluetooth (Mac crackling issues):Those crackling issues you've read about? They exist. You're probably wondering why I'm still giving these headphones 5 stars, well it's because through my testing, it doesn't seem to be the fault of the headphones (also this issue is fixable). How is it possible that these things play perfectly off of my mobile devices but start to crackle when streaming from my Macbook? After digging deeper, it seems that OS X makes some bluetooth fidelity tradeoffs for who knows what reason (maybe better power consumption?). This sucks, because I like streaming at the highest quality available to me. However it is fixable, you just need to go into terminal and make some changes and restart your machine. Remember to apply changes as superuser (ie. $ sudo su).

Of course, I also got them for significantly cheaper so that may skew my opinion of them so keep that in mind.EDIT: Bose has been really quick about finding a solution to the issue on OS X 10, so the above advice is no longer really needed. Props to them for delivering a fix so quickly! (update at updates.bose.com/soundlinkae2). As mentioned in their comment below, they expect upgrading to El Capitan should fix the issue, but I cannot verify this at the moment.

Second, if you want to put them on to just block ambient noise they quickly go into shutdown and give no noise reduction.  Really unfortunate.  Third, not sure what you do on an airplane.  Many don't allow Bluetooth, so back to the wire, I guess. But can the Bluetooth even be turned off? No gain on airplanes.  And, if your ambient noise is on a plane, you're got by both points two and three.  Fourth, rechargeable (inaccessible) battery.  If you want to own these for the long term, this is bad. Within the ten years my first ones have gone, pretty sure I'd have had to replace the whole unit a couple of times due to flagging batteries.  Popping in a fresh AAA now and again is pretty simple by comparison. Easy to stock a spare and instantly change out.100% reliable, very inexpensive.  BTW, Bose did not exactly go all out to help you charge...providing a charging cord that is only about a foot long and no charger at all.It could be that some of these drawbacks could be solved in some mysterious way by punching or holding a magic combination of the few buttons on the device.  But don't expect to get any guidance from the in-package documents.  Confusingly multi-lingual, very cryptic, very limited in scope. Useless!I regret to say that I am very disappointed. I expected much better for the money and from Bose. One small step up to wireless but many big steps down in usability!

            ","I have owned, enjoyed and appreciated Bose headphones since 2006 of both in/on/over noise cancelling or without noise cancelling products.  Being a long time Bose home theater audio products and headphone user, it was natural for me to purchase a pair of Bose SoundLink around-ear wireless II headphones.  By the way these are my 4th Bose headphone in last 8 years.I have always paid premium price for Bose products do not mind to pay the extra for the quality.After all, “Quality cost for sure.......”My experience with Bose headphones are their rich deep and filling with great mid's and balanced sound. Wife tells me, she can hear mid to high sounds in my QC3 that no other headphone can produce.Coming from that type of quality, I was just shocked to the sound quality of these headphones.  No depth in sound, lack of base, low volume, lack of fidelity and definition.This product should have a label that says “Long time BOSE user - Please Do not Touch - This is not BOSE Quality Sound”After a week of use – Here are my pros & cons on this product.Pros –Great Wireless capability.Stable Bluetooth performance.  Pairs easy.Great microphone for phone use (Wife could not believe I was using my headphones mic)Fairly comfortable to wear and good battery life.Cons –Absolutely not Bose quality sound by no means.No depth in sound, lack of base, low volume, lack of fidelity and definition. (Compared to Bose Quiet-Comfort 3)Good Construction but cheap look.Poor quality sound does not justify paying premium price.Like another gentlemen said, one step forward to wireless 5 steps back on sound quality for Bose.I will be returning these headphones for something else.  Maybe for a Beats Studio wireless (bought one last year for my brother that has descent sound quality)

This morning it keeps doing it and I cannot resolve it; removed and re-paired, reset the headphones.  EDIT: Another issue is when you call up siri (press-hold the center button used for play/pause) the mic picks up lots of background noise. So after you speak your command to siri, it doesn't beep back to do the command because it hears the background noise. So unless you are in a quiet setting, siri is useless.These will have to go back. No way I can accept this kind of performance.

            ","Pros--------- Excellent Sound quality- Very comfortable- Microphone captures high-quality sound- Battery lasts 8 hours (or more)Cons--------- Microphone captures everything in front of me.- Control design is too simplistic- No Mute button- Odd choice of audio cable jackBelow is written in order of descending importance:First and foremost, the sound quality is excellent.  There is a good balance between treble and bass that sounds great whether I'm listening to an audio book, Nightwish, or Lupe Fisaco.  Even though they don't boast Noise Cancelling features, the design of the headphones do a good job of reducing outside noise.The around-the-ear pads and head cushions make these things comfortable enough to wear for several hours on end.  Which is great with the battery life.  I get about 8 hours using Bluetooth, and it seems like more when listening through a wired connection (though I haven't ran a full battery test on wired).Next up is the microphone, which I'm on the fence about.  The sound quality it captures is pretty good, especially for a by-the-ear microphone design.  My problem with it is that it captures high quality footsteps, keyboard clicks, etc.  Pretty much any distinct sound not behind or to the left of me.  I appreciate the unobtrusive nature of this design, but in my opinion an ideal microphone would only capture the voice of the user.  As such, this headset is not well suited for voice-heavy applications like teleconferencing or in-game chatting.The ambient sounds captured wouldn't be such a problem if Bose had not decided to omit something that I consider vital in any headset, a mute button.  In fact, the controls are too simple in my mind.  Two buttons for volume, good.  A soft-switch for power and Bluetooth connection, good.  A single button for pause/resume, forward, backward, accept/make calls; what?  It's takes some getting use to the timing required to not scroll through the commands.  Most of that is nitpicking, but a mute button would have been very nice to have.One last nitpick.  The headphones come with a wired option and include a cable to connect to standard headphone jacks.  The odd thing is that this isn't a standard 3.5mm male-to-male connection.  The jack on the product is much smaller, presumably requiring the buyer to get any replacements from Bose.If you're wondering why I gave 5 stars after all these complaints, it's because this is not marketed as a telecom/gaming headset but rather as headphones that can handle the odd call.  So only the sound, comfort, and battery life counted in my overall score.  The rest I included for the sake of completeness.

            ","Full disclosure: I recieved a pair of these headphones in exchange for an honest review, and I do intend to provide an *honest* review.I am a musician with professional equipment and avid audio enthusiast, thus, I have a full array of headphones in my house ranging from bottom end $9 earbuds all the way up to $300 Pioneer studio monitoring cans.In the past, I was extremely impressed with Bose speakers but less so with their headphones.  I was extremely grateful and eager to give these wireless (bluetooth) headphones a full workout to see how far the Bose sound has evolved over the years...My first impression upon opening the headphones was that they are extremely high quality in look and feel.  The ear cans and headband have an attractive, low profile design and there is no obvious exteriro wireless ""module"" as in the previous model of SoundLink headphones.There is a carrying case (zippered and molded) along with a USB cable for charging and a standard 35mm headphone jack cable for using the headset non-wirelessly (note: no battery charge is required whatsoever to use them as wired headphones.)I first plugged these into my iPhone (wired) and went for a jog toggling between an audiobook and spotify.  The headphones themselves were very lightweight and comfortable.  They did a great job blocking out ambient noise. After about an hour, however, they caused my ears/head to sweat pretty badly and I decided to switch them out with my usual earbuds out of concern for damaging them.Back at home, I plugged these into my PC and listened to some high-fidelity (lossless, *.FLAC) audio files to compare them to my high-end Sony studio monitors.  I found them to have quite a bit less depth than the Sonys and much less of an acoustic range.  I expected this given that Bose are not known for producing studio-replicate equil/frequencies.I watched Netflix on my iPad (wirelessly) to give the battery life a test after doing a full, 8 hour charge. Leaving the iPad and the headphones running, I found them to give an astounding 10 hours of life before finally dimming out! I consider this to be outstanding performance and was very impressed! For traveling and wireless listening (through smartphones and tablets) this put these headphones right at the top of their class for both performance, comfort and sound quality.The final test I put them through was with FaceTime call (wireless) to test the microphone.  The mic was able to capture ambient noise in my house (the air conditioner, the sink running in the kitchen, the laundry and dishwasher) and created quite a bit of rumble in the background.  It seems to lack some filtering capabilities or is extremely sensitive without a way to adjust it.  I also noticed at this point that there was no mute button for the mic on the headset, rather I had to depend on the particular app/device to provide a software button for muting.Overall, these are absolutely fantastic headphones if you intend to use them for on-the-go/travel and wireless high-fidelity listening.  Theres nominal noise cancelling, however, these are not considered true noise-cancelling headphones.  They are extremely comfortable to wear and are infinitely more attractive than the similarly priced BEATS headphones (and sound better too!).  For their niche, these are an oustanding choice.  If you anticipate using them for sports/active use or mainly wired listening, there are probably much more attractively priced options that will provide the same quality sound.Enthusiastically recommended! I'm happy to answer any more specific questions to the best of my abilities.

"1939",5,"September 28, 2015","Color: Black",FALSE,"Outstanding control, sound, comfort and design
            ","I am reviewing a pair of Bose SoundLink AE2 wireless headphones that I received at no cost through the Amazon Vine program.This is my first foray into top of the line headphones, a significant step up from my old Sony MDR CD60 (whose earpads have been worn into black rubber dust). I immediately noticed a substantial upgrade in comfort and a sense of solidness to the headphones. That's not to say the MDR CD60 were something to sneeze at (despite the rubber dust), but rather that this is the kind of advance I'd expect from 20 years of innovation. The headband is made of soft, supple leather covering a sturdy band that is more flexible than the old pair. The band extends as I'd expect, but the headphones swivel about 90 degrees. This is (I'd think) mainly for comfort so that the ear pieces can turn to the shape of the user's head, but also so they can lay flatter to fit into the zippered leather and canvas carrying case (a nice, but unnecessary, touch). The ear pieces themselves have that new leather feel and smell and are solidly metal and plastic. They are large enough to fully-encompass the ear within the leather, and there's enough cushion in the pads that they really don't press on my ears as some others do. They also effectively block much of the rest of the sound in the room. I'm impressed from the wearing as these are easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned.I'm listening happily to the ""Shadows of Esteren"" soundtrack, wired into my PC (there's a 3' cord included), but the real feat to these headphones is the Bluetooth and associated controls. As I open the same soundtrack on the same Youtube account on my smartphone, I also unplug the headphones from the PC and I'm greeted by the friendly, but definitely electronic, voice of the AE2 telling me it's now connecting to my device (I had previously connected to my phone's Bluetooth). The sound is perhaps even more crisp and clear than it was over the wire. If I want to flip to my wife's phone (again, I'd previously connected to her phone as well), I need only push the button on the right earpiece up and it will tell me her device. She gives me an annoyed look, and I turn back to my phone.Let's talk sound quality. It's everything I'd expect from a Bose. Warm, powerful, capturing all the bass, oboe and hue of ""Mor Forsair"" by Delphine Bois. I'd say that Bose speaks for itself but I truly have to describe how luscious the sound is that comes from these headphones. There is some fuzz as the bass-heavy track passes the capacity of the headphones, but I have it up way to loud to be able to notice this.The sound may be too loud but it's easy to turn down with the volume buttons beneath and behind the right headphone. There's also a button to pause the current track (it even works on Youtube on your phone). I suppose the only additional feature one could ask for would be a skip or reverse button but I am quite happy with this headset.Five stars for outstanding comfort, exquisite sound, innovative design and control, and really good use of the Bluetooth technology.

            ","As one might expect from an outfit like Bose (at least from their reputation), this is a very nice headset.Comfort-wise, it is one of the nicer sets I have ever used, being light weight, yet solid and having good sound quality. The leather ear cuffs are the softest and most comfortable I have felt. They are very nice indeed.They come in a very nice case with a pocket for the cables.As a bluetooth headset, it can do calls or media sound wirelessly from your bluetooth-enabled device (smart phone, etc.). As a wired headphone, it can function as a regular set of stereo headphones. In both cases, the audio quality is good - solid bass, clear highs, good isolation and separation, etc. The microphone worked adequately for making these a hands-free phone headset, but does pick up a lot of room noise, at least partly because of its position.I have a couple of minor nitpicks which should only be worth a half star or so, but I can't rate by half a star, so be aware of that (these are actually more like 4.5 to 4.7 stars). The instructions are pretty mediocre, with some confusing diagrams and not much in the way of clear, full sentences. Now I understand that there are those who like the ""challenge"" of treating every new piece of gear as an Easter egg hunt, but I am not one of them. I prefer clear, unambiguous explanations of functions and capabilities, and Bose falls pretty short here.In a $20 piece of gear, I can forgive mediocre instructions - in gear this expensive I expect better. When you find $20 gear with instructions significantly better than over-$100 gear from someone like Bose, that deserves some notice. Remember, the job isn't finished until the paperwork is done.The other minor nitpick is with the included audio cable (and nice that they included it - no complaint there) - Why the choice of 2.5mm plug on one end (headphone end) and 3.5mm on the other? That is just strange. It means that one can only use the cable in one direction, and one must pay attention to the orientation of the cable when using it. The difference in space taken up by the larger (and far more common) size plug/jack combination is small, and in an item the size of the earpiece, I do not see the need to make such an odd compromise. Not critical, but annoying for no reason (unless the accountant says they need to save a few pennies on each unit - again a bit of silliness on an item this expensive, but understandable if you know accountants of this type).All in all a great set of bluetooth headphones. For noisy environments, or times when you want to listen to something and not be encumbered by headphone cables, these should work well. If you need (or want) something like this, you should seriously consider these. Definitely very nice headphones.

I've never had, or felt I needed, wireless as I am quite happy with my Bose SoundTrue I and SoundTrue II, as well as my IE earphones, SoundDock II, etc.  I had to return the QC25s as the pressure on my eardrums was too much, but I thought they were great headphones for most people.  These phones don't grab me too much because I found I really didn't need to be wireless.  I'm not clumsy where I pull or break the cables on my headphones, and with wired, I can walk a mile or five miles and not worry about range.  I often walk our dog and with wireless I'd still have to carry my device to play music.  Specifically, though, what I didn't like about these were:  Minor skipping of songs occurred.  Songs sounded fine, but there also is a lack of presence that seems to be missing for me.  Very importantly, I hate the idea of another battery to keep charged too, especially when there is no noise cancelling.  With the QC25s, you have noise cancelling AND you don't have to worry about wearing out a non-consumer replaceable battery...you simply put a new, inexpensive AAA battery in.  But these have to be charged and noise cancelling is only passive, not active.  I suppose for those who feel they can't deal with wires, these will work, though they are more maintenance and are about $100 more than regular Bose SoundTrues.

            ","BOSE is a company that has truly fallen far. They used to be the kind of company who took pride in their products, who made expensive gear that never lost its new car smell. Unfortunately this hasn't been the case for years. Remember the first BOSE IEMs? Completely useless crap. And these are no better. In fact, I would conservatively describe them as complete garbage. They look nice. The build quality is decent. Only problem? The IEMs that came with my first iPod sound better than these. I live in New York City. I wanted some headphones I could wear on the street, that would allow me to make and receive calls, and that would reproduce my music without too much distortion. I wasn't thinking of some Wireless version of the Senn 800s. I just wanted a portable bluetooth headphone that weren't ostentatious, and that's it. I was even willing to pay a couple hundred dollars for that. Too much to ask? Alas, yes it is if you're asking BOSE.First of all, you can't listen to loud music on these cans because they don't have volume capacity. The first day I took them outdoors - and if you've ever been to New York City, you know that we city folk spend a good deal of time walking around NOT hearing all the hustle and bustle - I missed 3 phone calls because I didn't hear the ringer, even though the volume was turned up all the way. When I tried some music - not Hi Res or anything like that, you know, just 256/kps AACs and MP3s from iTunes -  I couldn't even tell what I was listening to. Treble? Bass? Soundstage? Huh? Indoors I could hear well enough to identify the music, but even at MAX volume, not much else. But what did I expect?When BOSE first issued the ""noise cancelling"" headphones, everyone went nuts. You couldn't get on an airplane in the Western Hemisphere without seeing at least 4 or 5 people sporting Quiet Comfort 15s and snoring away. Hack reviewers fell all over themselves praising them. It is true that the noise cancelling is pretty good on those headphones and on their successors. But the sound was and is mediocre at best. Little to no sound stage. Little to no low end. Muddy mid-range made muddier by the hum of the noise-cancelling technology. They were okay. Not $300 okay. Just okay. But at least you could crank them. Compared to the Soundlink series, the QC15s were audio heaven.On the QC15s,  there was a default, out-of-the-box setting which kept the maximum volume pretty low, but there was a little switch hidden inside one of the cups that disabled that hall monitor of a feature. You know, just in case you might be a grown up who can make your own decisions. So when I first tried these out, I immediately assumed that there was such a switch inside the Soundlinks as well because, while I could basically hear the music I was listening to well enough to identify it, they were ridiculously quiet on MAX volume. But I couldn't find it. So I called Bose to inquire where it was, and what do you think happened? Right, there is no switch. That was as loud as they could go. I thought there might be a power problem, but no. It's as if the engineers at Bose are all deaf people. It's as if the person who spec'd out the design for volume control was a pinch-mouthed librarian who decided that people really do listen to music through their headphones too loudly for their own good, and by gosh, BOSE was going to put a stop to that nonsense. Which might possibly make some sense if it were true, but it isn't true. I'm sure that people do listen to music at unsafe levels, but those levels are so far beyond the capacity of the Soundlinks as to be practically in another galaxy. The sound from these cans is MUTED.And anyway, so what? Even if it were true that I like to listen to music at ""dangerously"" high volume, isn't that my prerogative? I am over 21. I can ruin my hearing if I want. Never mind. Just move along. if you listen exclusively indoors, consider the Fidelio X2s - an amazing open back headphone that sounds like it should cost $600-$700, but which actually cost less than these (last time I looked they were $239). Or if you need a closed back, try the V-Moda M100s at around $250. If you absolutely MUST have bluetooth, Westone has just introduced a bluetooth cable that attaches to their own high-end IEMS, which also fit most SHURE IEMs (215, 425, 535, 846). At $149, it's the best wireless listening I've ever heard.Second, the company is complete crap. I had originally bought two pairs of these, one for me and one for my partner. He hated them more than even I did, so I decided to send them back. I tried to do this online, but that is not possible because you have to get a return authorization from a human being, so my only option was to call customer service. So, OF COURSE there was ""unusually high call volume"" at the time I called (it isn't unusual; it's ALWAYS), so I had to wait on hold for 44 minutes before someone answered. And when I asked for a ""no questions asked"" return authorization, OF COURSE there were questions. ""Why are you returning them?"" ""Because SOUND. Duh."" etc. So I got the authorization and sent each pair back in their original packing materials.  After a month of silence, I broke down and called again. 47 minute wait this time. When a person finally answered I explained my problem and what do you think happened next. I WAS DISCONNECTED. I tried emails. Four emails to be precise. Not one of them was even acknowledged. And nowll, it has been 3 months now and I haven't even gotten an email, much less my $500 refund. I will update this if they ever refund my money.Plus, Bose headphones are just not good at anything other than noise cancelling. At any volume. Bose tarted them up from the original bluetooth headphones they made, and added $100 to the asking price. They do look much better than the old A! wireless over-ear cans, but as far as I can tell, the sound is indistinguishable. And this is because BOSE, evidently, no longer cares about sound. I'm not sure they ever did, but when I was younger, the BOSE 901s were considered the Rolls Royce of floorstanding speakers and BOSE was considered a high-end audio company. Well, if that were ever true, it is not anymore. Let me put it this way: If you are the type of person who thinks that it is a scientific fact that human beings cannot hear the difference between lossy and lossless audio, who gets down on your knees and thanks the Lord for single speaker mini-bluetooth speakers because now you can listen to FOX NEWS RADIO in the shower, and your idea of audio-luxury is a pair of Quiet Comforts hooked up to a Wave Radio, you will love these. Do not hestitate. Hand over your moneys. Otherwise, don't waste your time, much less your cash.
